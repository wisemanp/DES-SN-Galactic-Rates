abstract = {We present the first cosmological parameter constraints using measurements of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program (DES-SN). The analysis uses a subsample of 207 spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia from the first three years of DES-SN, combined with a low-redshift sample of 122 SNe from the literature. Our "DES-SN3YR" result from these 329 SNe Ia is based on a series of companion analyses and improvements covering SN Ia discovery, spectroscopic selection, photometry, calibration, distance bias corrections, and evaluation of systematic uncertainties. For a flat LCDM model we find a matter density Omega_m = 0.331 +_ 0.038. For a flat wCDM model, and combining our SN Ia constraints with those from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), we find a dark energy equation of state w = -0.978 +_ 0.059, and Omega_m = 0.321 +_ 0.018. For a flat w0waCDM model, and combining probes from SN Ia, CMB and baryon acoustic oscillations, we find w0 = -0.885 +_ 0.114 and wa = -0.387 +_ 0.430. These results are in agreement with a cosmological constant and with previous constraints using SNe Ia (Pantheon, JLA).},

abstract = {This paper describes the Fifth Data Release (DR5) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). DR5 includes all survey quality data taken through 2005 June and represents the completion of the SDSS-I project (whose successor, SDSS-II, will continue through mid-2008). It includes five-band photometric data for 217 million objects selected over 8000 deg 2 and 1,048,960 spectra of galaxies, quasars, and stars selected from 5713 deg 2 ofthat imaging data. These numbers represent a roughly 20% increment over those of the Fourth Data Release; all the data from previous data releases are included in the present release. In addition to "standard" SDSS observations, DR5 includes repeat scans of the southern equatorial stripe, imaging scans across M31 and the core of the Perseus Cluster of galaxies, and the first spectroscopic data from SEGUE, a survey to explore the kinematics and chemical evolution of the Galaxy. The catalog database incorporates several new features, including photometric redshifts of galaxies, tables of matched objects in overlap regions of the imaging survey, and tools that allow precise computations of survey geometry for statistical investigations. ? 2007.

abstract = {We study the abundance of silicon in the intergalactic medium by analyzing the statistics of Si IV, C IV, and H I pixel optical depths in a sample of 19 high-quality quasar absorption spectra, which we compare with realistic spectra drawn from a hydrodynamical simulation. Simulations with a constant and uniform Si/C ratio, a C distribution as derived in Paper II of this series, and a UV background (UVB) model from Haardt & Madau reproduce the observed trends in the ratio of Si IV and C IV optical depths, $\tau$SiIV/$\tau$CIV. The ratio $\tau$SiIV/$\tau$CIV depends strongly on $\tau$CIV, but it is nearly independent of redshift for fixed $\tau$CIV and is inconsistent with a sharp change in the hardness of the UVB at z$\sim$3. Scaling the simulated optical depth ratios gives a measurement of the global Si/C ratio (using our fiducial UVB, which includes both galaxy and quasar contributions) of [Si/C]=0.77+/-0.05, with a possible systematic error of $\sim$0.1 dex. The inferred [Si/C] depends on the shape of the UVB (harder backgrounds leading to higher [Si/C]), ranging from [Si/C]$\sim$=1.5 for a quasar-only UVB to [Si/C]$\sim$=0.25 for a UVB including both galaxies and artificial softening; this provides the dominant uncertainty in the overall [Si/C]. Examination of the full $\tau$SiIV/$\tau$CIV distribution yields no evidence for inhomogeneity in [Si/C] and constrains the width of a lognormal probability distribution in [Si/C] to be much smaller than that of [C/H]; this implies a common origin for Si and C. Since the inferred [Si/C] depends on the UVB shape, this also suggests that inhomogeneities in the hardness of the UVB are small. There is no evidence for evolution in [Si/C]. Variation in the inferred [Si/C] with density depends on the UVB and rules out the quasar-only model unless [Si/C] increases sharply at low density. Comparisons with low-metallicity halo stars and nucleosynthetic yields suggest either that our fiducial UVB is too hard or that supermassive Population III stars might have to be included. The inferred [Si/C], if extrapolated to low density, corresponds to a contribution to the cosmic Si abundance of [Si/H]=-2.0, or $\Omega$Si$\sim$=3.2×10-7, a significant fraction of all Si production expected by z$\sim$3. Based on public data obtained from the ESO archive of observations from the UVES spectrograph at the VLT, Paranal, Chile and on data obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The W. M. Keck Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.},

This will be the first release of data from the Southern Hemisphere Survey of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment 2 (APOGEE-2); new data from APOGEE-2 North are also included. DR16 is also notable as the final data release to contain data (spectra) from the main cosmological program of the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS), and all raw and reduced spectra from that project are released here. DR16 also includes the last data from the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey (TDSS) and new data from the SPectroscopic IDentification of ERosita Survey (SPIDERS) programs, both of which co-observed on eBOSS plates. DR16 has no new data from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey (or the MaNGA Stellar Library "MaStar"). We also preview future SDSS-V operations (due to start in 2020), and summarize plans for the final SDSS-IV data release (DR17).},

abstract = {We present metal abundances in 15 damped Lyman alpha systems (DLAs) from the Complete Optical and Radio Absorption Line System (CORALS) survey, designed to be free from any biasing effects due to extinction of QSOs by dust in intervening absorbers. It has long been suggested that such biasing may explain differences in metallicity between DLAs and coeval luminous galaxies, and between model predictions and observations. We use our measured zinc and chromium abundances (combined with those for five more CORALS DLAs from the literature, giving us a very nearly complete sample) to test whether the metallicity and degree of dust depletion in CORALS DLAs are significantly different from those of existing, larger, samples of DLAs drawn from magnitude limited, optical surveys. We find that the column density weighted metallicity of CORALS DLAs, [<(Zn/H)_DLA>] = -0.88 +/- 0.21 in the redshift interval 1.86 < z(abs) < 3.45, is only marginally higher than that of a control sample from the recent compilation by Kulkarni et al., [<(Zn/H)_DLA>] = -1.09 +/- 0.10. With the present limited statistics this difference is not highly significant. Furthermore, we find no evidence for increased dust depletions in CORALS DLAs--their [Cr/Zn] ratios conform to the known trend of increasing depletion (decreasing [Cr/Zn]) with increasing metallicity, and we have encountered no cases where Cr is as depleted as in local cold interstellar clouds. These results, when combined with the earlier findings of the CORALS survey reported by Ellison et al. in 2001, make it difficult to invoke a dust-induced bias to explain the generally low level of chemical evolution exhibited by most DLAs. Rather, they indicate that large scale optical QSO surveys give a fair census of the population of high redshift absorbers.},

abstract = {Using H$\alpha$ emission as a tracer of ongoing (<16Myr old) and near-ultraviolet (UV) emission as a tracer of recent (16-100Myr old) star formation, we present constraints on the properties of core-collapse (CC) supernova (SN) progenitors through the association of their explosion sites with star-forming regions. Amalgamating previous results with those gained from new data, we present statistics of a large sample of SNe; 163.5 Type II (58 IIP, 13 IIL, 13.5 IIb, 19 IIn and 12 'impostors', plus 48 with no sub-type classification) and 96.5 Type Ib/c (39.5 Ib and 52 Ic, plus five with no sub-type classification). Using pixel statistics we build distributions of associations of different SN types with host galaxy star formation. Our main findings and conclusions are as follows. 1 An increasing progenitor mass sequence is observed, implied from an increasing association of SNe to host galaxy H$\alpha$ emission. This commences with the Type Ia showing the weakest association, followed by the Type II, then the Ib, with the Type Ic showing the strongest correlation to star-forming regions. Thus, our progenitor mass sequence runs Ia-II-Ib-Ic. 2 Overall, the Type Ibc SNe are found to occur nearer to bright Hii regions than SNe of Type II. This implies that the former have shorter stellar lifetimes, thus arising from more massive progenitor stars. 3 While Type IIP SNe do not closely follow the ongoing star formation, they accurately trace the recent formation. This implies that their progenitors arise from stars at the low end of the CC SN mass sequence, consistent with direct detections of progenitors in pre-explosion imaging. 4 Similarly, the Type IIn SNe trace recent but not the ongoing star formation. This implies that, contrary to the general consensus, the majority of these SN do not arise from the most massive stars. Results and suggestive constraints are also presented for the less numerous SNe of Types IIL and IIb, and SN 'impostors'. Finally, we present an analysis of possible biases in the data, the results of which argue strongly against any selection effects that could explain the relative excess of Type Ibc SNe within bright Hii regions. Thus, intrinsic progenitor differences in the sense of the mass sequence we propose remain the most plausible explanation of our findings. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2012 RAS.},

abstract = {We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3 UV and near-IR (nIR) imaging of 21 Superluminous Supernovae (SLSNe) host galaxies, providing a sensitive probe of star formation and stellar mass with the hosts. Comparing the photometric and morphological properties of these host galaxies with those of core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs), we find SLSN hosts are fainter and more compact at both UV and nIR wavelengths, in some cases we barely recover hosts with absolute magnitude around MV $\sim$ -14. With the addition of ground based optical observations and archival results, we produce spectral energy distribution (SED) fits to these hosts, and show that SLSN hosts possess lower stellar mass and star formation rates. This is most pronounced for the hydrogen deficient Type-I SLSN hosts, although Type-II H-rich SLSN host galaxies remain distinct from the bulk of CCSNe, spanning a remarkably broad range of absolute magnitudes, with $\sim$30% of SLSNe-II arising from galaxies fainter than Mn I R $\sim$ -14. The detection of our faintest SLSN hosts increases the confidence that SLSNe-I hosts are distinct from those of LGRBs in star formation rate and stellar mass, and suggests that apparent similarities in metallicity may be due to the limited fraction of hosts for which emission line metallicity measurements are feasible. The broad range of luminosities of SLSN-II hosts is difficult to describe by metallicity cuts, and does not match the expectations of any reasonable UV-weighted luminosity function, suggesting additional environmental constraints are likely necessary to yield hydrogen rich SLSNe.},

abstract = {We present a sample of 21 hydrogen-free superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I), and one hydrogen-rich SLSN (SLSN-II) detected during the five-year Dark Energy Survey (DES). These SNe, located in the redshift range 0.220<z<1.998, represent the largest homogeneously-selected sample of SLSN events at high redshift. We present the observed g,r, i, z light curves for these SNe, which we interpolate using Gaussian Processes. The resulting light curves are analysed to determine the luminosity function of SLSN-I, and their evolutionary timescales. The DES SLSN-I sample significantly broadens the distribution of SLSN-I light curve properties when combined with existing samples from the literature. We fit a magnetar model to our SLSNe, and find that this model alone is unable to replicate the behaviour of many of the bolometric light curves. We search the DES SLSN-I light curves for the presence of initial peaks prior to the main light-curve peak. Using a shock breakout model, our Monte Carlo search finds that 3 of our 14 events with pre-max data display such initial peaks. However, 10 events show no evidence for such peaks, in some cases down to an absolute magnitude of <-16, suggesting that such features are not ubiquitous to all SLSN-I events. We also identify a red pre-peak feature within the light curve of one SLSN, which is comparable to that observed within SN2018bsz.},

This survey consists of 275 deg 2 of repeated scanning by the SDSS camera over -50° ≤ $\alpha$ ≤ 60°and -1.°25 ≤ $\delta$ ≤ +1.°25 centered on the Celestial Equator. Each piece of sky has 20 runs contributing and thus reaches 2 mag fainter than the SDSS single pass data, i.e., to r 23.5 for galaxies. We discuss the image processing of the coaddition, the modeling of the point-spread function (PSF), the calibration, and the production of standard SDSS catalogs. The data have an r-band median seeing of 1.″1 and are calibrated to ≤1%. Star color-color, number counts, and PSF size versus modeled size plots show that the modeling of the PSF is good enough for precision five-band photometry. Structure in the PSF model versus magnitude plot indicates minor PSF modeling errors, leading to misclassification of stars as galaxies, as verified using VVDS spectroscopy. There are a variety of uses for this wide-angle deep imaging data, including galactic structure, photometric redshift computation, cluster finding and cross wavelength measurements, weak lensing cluster mass calibrations, and cosmic shear measurements.},

abstract = {We perform smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of an isolated galaxy with a new treatment for dust formation and destruction. To this aim, we treat dust and metal production self-consistently with star formation and supernova feedback. For dust, we consider a simplified model of grain size distribution by representing the entire range of grain sizes with large and small grains. We include dust production in stellar ejecta, dust destruction by supernova (SN) shocks, grain growth by accretion and coagulation, and grain disruption by shattering. We find that the assumption of fixed dust-to-metal mass ratio becomes no longer valid when the galaxy is older than 0.2 Gyr, at which point the grain growth by accretion starts to contribute to the nonlinear rise of dust-to-gas ratio. As expected in our previous one-zone model, shattering triggers grain growth by accretion since it increases the total surface area of grains. Coagulation becomes significant when the galaxy age is greater than $\sim$ 1 Gyr: at this epoch the abundance of small grains becomes high enough to raise the coagulation rate of small grains. We further compare the radial profiles of dust-to-gas ratio $(\mathcal{D})$ and dust-to-metal ratio $(\mathcal{D}/Z)$ (i.e., depletion) at various ages with observational data. We find that our simulations broadly reproduce the radial gradients of dust-to-gas ratio and depletion. In the early epoch ($\lesssim 0.3$ Gyr), the radial gradient of $\mathcal{D}$ follows the metallicity gradient with $\mathcal{D}/Z$ determined by the dust condensation efficiency in stellar ejecta, while the $\mathcal{D}$ gradient is steeper than the $Z$ gradient at the later epochs because of grain growth by accretion. The framework developed in this paper is applicable to any SPH-based galaxy evolution simulations including cosmological ones.},

abstract = {We analyse a sample of 16 absorption systems intrinsic to long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxies at z ≳ 2 for which the metallicities are known. We compare the relation between the metallicity and cold gas velocity width for this sample to that of the QSO-DLAs (quasi-stellar object-damped Lyman $\alpha$), and find complete agreement. We then compare the redshift evolution of the mass-metallicity relation of our sample to that of QSO-DLAs and find that also GRB hosts favour a late onset of this evolution, around a redshift of ≈2.6. We compute predicted stellar masses for the GRB host galaxies using the prescription determined from QSO-DLA samples and compare the measured stellar masses for the four hosts where stellar masses have been determined from spectral energy distribution (SED) fits. We find excellent agreement and conclude that, on basis of all available data and tests, long-duration GRB-DLA hosts and intervening QSO-DLAs are consistent with being drawn from the same underlying population. GRB host galaxies and QSO-DLAs are found to have different impact parameter distributions and we briefly discuss how this may affect statistical samples. The impact parameter distribution has two effects. First, any metallicity gradient will shift the measured metallicity away from the metallicity in the centre of the galaxy, and secondly, the path of the sightline through different parts of the potential well of the dark matter halo will cause different velocity fields to be sampled. We report evidence suggesting that this second effect may have been detected.},

abstract = {The kilonova associated with GW170817 displayed early blue emission which has been interpreted as a signature of either radioactive decay in low-opacity ejecta, relativistic boosting of radioactive decay in high-velocity ejecta, the cooling of material heated by a wind or by a "cocoon" surrounding a jet, or a combination thereof. Distinguishing between these mechanisms is important for constraining the ejecta components and their parameters, which tie directly into the physics we can learn from these events. I compile published ultraviolet, optical, and infrared light curves of the GW170817 kilonova and examine whether the combined data set can be used to distinguish between early-emission models. The combined optical data show an early rise consistent with radioactive decay of low opacity ejecta as the main emission source, but the subsequent decline is fit well by all models. A lack of constraints on the ultraviolet flux during the first few hours after discovery allows for both radioactive decay and other cooling mechanisms to explain the early bolometric light curve. This analysis demonstrates that early (few hours after merger) high-cadence optical and ultraviolet observations will be critical for determining the source of blue emission in future kilonovae.},

abstract = {We present the results of a Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) archival search for blue transients which lie in the magnitude range between "normal" core-collapse and superluminous supernovae (i.e. with $-21\,{\leq}M_{R\,(peak)}\,{\leq}-19$). Of the six events found after excluding all interacting Type$\sim$IIn and Ia-CSM supernovae, three (PTF09ge, 09axc and 09djl) are coincident with the centers of their hosts, one (10iam) is offset from the center, and for two (10nuj and 11glr) a precise offset can not be determined. All the central events have similar rise times to the He-rich tidal disruption candidate PS1-10jh, and the event with the best-sampled light curve also has similar colors and power-law decay. Spectroscopically, PTF09ge is He-rich, while PTF09axc and 09djl display broad hydrogen features around peak magnitude. All three central events are in low star-formation hosts, two of which are E+A galaxies. Our spectrum of the host of PS1-10jh displays similar properties. PTF10iam, the one offset event, is different photometrically and spectroscopically from the central events and its host displays a higher star formation rate. Finding no obvious evidence for ongoing galactic nuclei activity or recent star formation, we conclude that the three central transients likely arise from the tidal disruption of a star by a super-massive black hole. We compare the spectra of these events to tidal disruption candidates from the literature and find that all of these objects can be unified on a continuous scale of spectral properties. The accumulated evidence of this expanded sample strongly supports a tidal disruption origin for this class of nuclear transients.},

abstract = {Long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) mark the birth of a compact object, a neutron star or black hole. At low-redshift ($z<0.2$) these events are extremely rare and most are poorly known. Four nearby GRBs have been associated with Type Ic supernovae (SNe Ic), . GRB/SNe lack hydrogen and helium, and are classified as SNe Ic, but have extremely broad features, which indicate the presence of material at very high velocities ($>0.3c$). They have a kinetic energy ($E_{k}$) of $\sim10^{52}$erg, and are thought to be the explosion of bare carbon-oxygen cores of stars with initial mass 35-50M$_\odot$. Here we report observations of the nearby GRB 161219B ($z=0.1475$) and the associated SN 2016jca. We obtained a high-cadence time-series of spectra and photometry starting 2 days after explosion. The GRB afterglow had a late achromatic break 12 days after outburst which indicates that the relativistic material was ejected in an outflow with a large opening angle. We first identified the SN 5 days after the GRB. Such an early detection gives us the opportunity to explore the outermost layers of the ejecta. We find the outer most ejecta are dominated by heavy elements, while lighter elements are present in high abundance at low velocities. Geometrically this suggests that we are viewing a high velocity nuclearly processed outflow down its axis. This and the wide opening angle suggests a highly magnetized millisecond pulsar may power the explosion.},

These events were detected and their multi-color light-curves measured using the MegaPrime/MegaCam instrument at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), by repeatedly imaging four one-square degree fields in four bands, as part of the CFHT Legacy Survey (CFHTLS). Follow-up spectroscopy was performed at the VLT, Gemini and Keck telescopes to confirm the nature of the supernovae and to measure their redshift. With this data set, we have built a Hubble diagram extending to z = 1, with all distance measurements involving at least two bands. Systematic uncertainties are evaluated making use of the multi-band photometry obtained at CFHT. Cosmological fits to this first year SNLS Hubble diagram give the following results: $\Omega$M = 0.263 ± 0.042 (stat) ± 0.032 (sys) for a flat ACDM model; and w = -1.023 ± 0.090 (stat) ± 0.054 (sys) for a flat cosmology with constant equation of state w when combined with the constraint from the recent Sloan Digital Sky Survey measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations. {\textcopyright} ESO 2006.},

abstract = {(Abridged) The Large Area Telescope (Fermi/LAT, hereafter LAT), the primary instrument on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi) mission, is an imaging, wide field-of-view, high-energy gamma-ray telescope, covering the energy range from below 20 MeV to more than 300 GeV. This paper describes the LAT, its pre-flight expected performance, and summarizes the key science objectives that will be addressed. On-orbit performance will be presented in detail in a subsequent paper. The LAT is a pair-conversion telescope with a precision tracker and calorimeter, each consisting of a 4x4 array of 16 modules, a segmented anticoincidence detector that covers the tracker array, and a programmable trigger and data acquisition system. Each tracker module has a vertical stack of 18 x,y tracking planes, including two layers (x and y) of single-sided silicon strip detectors and high-Z converter material (tungsten) per tray. Every calorimeter module has 96 CsI(Tl) crystals, arranged in an 8 layer hodoscopic configuration with a total depth of 8.6 radiation lengths. The aspect ratio of the tracker (height/width) is 0.4 allowing a large field-of-view (2.4 sr). Data obtained with the LAT are intended to (i) permit rapid notification of high-energy gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and transients and facilitate monitoring of variable sources, (ii) yield an extensive catalog of several thousand high-energy sources obtained from an all-sky survey, (iii) measure spectra from 20 MeV to more than 50 GeV for several hundred sources, (iv) localize point sources to 0.3 - 2 arc minutes, (v) map and obtain spectra of extended sources such as SNRs, molecular clouds, and nearby galaxies, (vi) measure the diffuse isotropic gamma-ray background up to TeV energies, and (vii) explore the discovery space for dark matter.},

abstract = {We describe data release 3 (DR3) of the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. The GAMA survey is a spectroscopic redshift and multiwavelength photometric survey in three equatorial regions each of 60.0 deg2 (G09, G12, and G15), and two southern regions of 55.7 deg2 (G02) and 50.6 deg2 (G23). DR3 consists of: the first release of data covering the G02 region and of data on H-ATLAS (Herschel - Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey) sources in the equatorial regions; and updates to data on sources released in DR2. DR3 includes 154 809 sources with secure redshifts across four regions. A subset of the G02 region is 95.5 per cent redshift complete to r < 19.8 mag over an area of 19.5 deg2, with 20 086 galaxy redshifts, that overlaps substantially with the XXL survey (X-ray) and VIPERS (redshift survey). In the equatorial regions, the main survey has even higher completeness (98.5 per cent), and spectra for about 75 per cent of H-ATLAS filler targets were also obtained. This filler sample extends spectroscopic redshifts, for probable optical counterparts to HATLAS submillimetre sources, to 0.8 mag deeper (r < 20.6 mag) than the GAMA main survey. There are 25 814 galaxy redshifts for H-ATLAS sources from the GAMA main or filler surveys.},

abstract = {We studied the time-averaged gamma-ray burst spectra accumulated by the spectroscopy detectors of the Burst and Transient Source Experiment. The spectra are described well at low energy by a power-law continuum with an exponential cutoff and by a steeper power law at high energy. However, the spectral parameters vary from burst to burst with no universal values. The break in the spectrum ranges from below 100 keV to more than 1 MeV, but peaks below 200 keV with only a small fraction of the spectra breaking above 400 keV; it is therefore unlikely that a majority of the burst spectra are shaped directly by pair processes, unless bursts originate from a broad redshift range. The correlations among burst parameters do not fulfill the predictions of the cosmological models of burst origin. No correlations with burst morphology or the spatial distribution were found. We demonstrate the importance of using a complete spectral description even if a partial description (e.g., a model without a high-energy tail) is statistically satisfactory.},

abstract = {We present the integrated stellar mass-metallicity relation (MZR) for more than 1700 galaxies included in the integral field area SDSS-IV MaNGA survey. The spatially resolved data allow us to determine the metallicity at the same physical scale (effective radius in arcsecs, $\mathrm{R_{eff}}$ ) using a heterogeneous set of ten abundance calibrators. Besides scale factors, the shape of the MZR is similar for all calibrators, consistent with those reported previously using single-fiber and integral field spectroscopy. We compare the residuals of this relation against the star formation rate (SFR) and specific SFR (sSFR). We do not find a strong secondary relation of the MZR with either SFR or the sSFR for any of the calibrators, in contrast with previous single-fiber spectroscopic studies. Our results agree with an scenario in which metal enrichment happens at local scales, with global outflows playing a secondary role in shaping the chemistry of galaxies and cold-gas inflows regulating the stellar formation.},

abstract = {The optical afterglow of gamma-ray burst GRB 020813 was observed for 3 hr with the LRIS spectropolarimeter at the Keck I telescope, beginning 4.7 hr after the burst was detected by the HETE-2. The spectrum reveals numerous metal absorption lines that we identify with two systems at z=1.223 and z=1.255. We also detect an [O II] $\lambda$3727 emission line at z=1.255, and we identify this galaxy as the likely host of the GRB. After a correction for Galactic interstellar polarization, the optical afterglow has a linear polarization of 1.8%-2.4% during 4.7-7.9 hr after the burst. A measurement of p=0.80%+/-0.16% on the following night by Covino et al. demonstrates significant polarization variability over the next 14 hr. The lack of strong variability in the position angle of linear polarization indicates that the magnetic field in the jet is likely to be globally ordered rather than composed of a number of randomly oriented cells. Within the framework of afterglow models with collimated flows, the relatively low observed polarization suggests that the magnetic field components perpendicular and parallel to the shock front are only different by about 20%.},

abstract = {The burst alert telescope (BAT) is one of three instruments on the Swift MIDEX spacecraft to study gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The BAT first detects the GRB and localizes the burst direction to an accuracy of 1-4 arcmin within 20 s after the start of the event. The GRB trigger initiates an autonomous spacecraft slew to point the two narrow field-of-view (FOV) instruments at the burst location within 20-70 s so to make follow-up X-ray and optical observations. The BAT is a wide-FOV, coded-aperture instrument with a CdZnTe detector plane. The detector plane is composed of 32,768 pieces of CdZnTe (4×4×2 mm), and the coded-aperture mask is composed of ∼52,000 pieces of lead (5×5×1 mm) with a 1-m separation between mask and detector plane. The BAT operates over the 15-150 keV energy range with ∼7 keV resolution, a sensitivity of ∼10 -8 erg s -1 cm -2, and a 1.4 sr (half-coded) FOV. We expect to detect > 100 GRBs/year for a 2-year mission. The BAT also performs an all-sky hard X-ray survey with a sensitivity of ∼2 m Crab (systematic limit) and it serves as a hard X-ray transient monitor. {\textcopyright} Springer 2005.},

abstract = {We present optical, near- and mid-infrared imaging of the host galaxy of FRB 121102 with the Gemini North telescope, the Hubble Space Telescope and the Spitzer Space Telescope. The FRB 121102 host galaxy is resolved, revealing a bright star forming region located in the outskirts of the irregular, low-metallicity dwarf galaxy. The star forming region has a half-light radius of 0.68 kpc (0.20 arcsec), encompassing the projected location of the compact (<0.7 pc), persistent radio source that is associated with FRB 121102. The half-light diameter of the dwarf galaxy is 5 to 7 kpc, and broadband spectral energy distribution fitting indicates that it has a total stellar mass of M*$\sim$10^8 Msun. The metallicity of the host galaxy is low, 12+log10 ([O/H])=8.0+-0.1. The properties of the host galaxy of FRB 121102 are comparable to those of extreme emission line galaxies, also known to host hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae and long-duration gamma-ray bursts. The projected location of FRB 121102 within the star forming region supports the proposed connection of FRBs with newly born neutron stars or magnetars.},

abstract = {AIMS: The aim of this study is to investigate the origin and evolution of Sc, V, Mn, and Co for a homogeneous and statistically significant sample of stars probing the different populations of the Milky Way, in particular the thin and thick disks. METHODS: Using high-resolution spectra obtained with MIKE, FEROS, SOFIN, FIES, UVES and HARPS spectrographs, we determine Sc, V, Mn, and Co abundances for a large sample of F and G dwarfs in Solar neighbourhood. The method is based on spectral synthesis and using one-dimensional (1-D), plane-parallel, LTE model stellar atmospheres calculated with the MARCS 2012 code. NLTE corrections from literature were applied to Mn and Co. RESULTS: We find that the abundance trends derived for Sc (594 stars), V (466 stars), and Co (567 stars) are very similar to what has been observed for the alpha-elements in the thin and thick disks. On the contrary Mn (569 stars) is generally underabundant relative to the Sun (i.e. [Mn/Fe]<0) for [Fe/H]<0. Also, for Mn, when NLTE corrections are applied, the trend changes and is almost flat over the entire metallicity range that the stars in our sample span (-2<[Fe/H]<+0.4). The [Sc/Fe]-[Fe/H] abundance trends show a small separation between the thin and thick disks, while for V and Co they completely overlap. For Mn there is a small difference in [Mn/Fe] but only when NLTE corrections are used. Comparisons with Ti as a reference element show flat trends for all the elements except for Mn that show well separated [Mn/Ti]-[Ti/H] trends for the thin and thick disks. CONCLUSIONS: Sc and V present trends compatible with production from SNII events. In addition, Sc clearly shows a metallicity dependence for [Fe/H]<-1. Mn instead is produced in SNII events for [Fe/H]<-0.4 and then SNIa start to produce Mn. Finally, Co appears to be produced mainly in SNII with suggestion of enrichment from hypernovae at low metallicities.},

abstract = {We measured evolution of the $K$-band luminosity function and stellar mass function for red and blue galaxies at $z<1.2$ using a sample of 353 594 $I<24$ galaxies in 8.26 square degrees of Bo\"otes. We addressed several sources of systematic and random error in measurements of total galaxy light, photometric redshift and absolute magnitude. We have found that the $K$-band luminosity density for both red and blue galaxies increased by a factor of 1.2 from $z\sim1.1$ to $z\sim0.3$, while the most luminous red (blue) galaxies decreased in luminosity by 0.19 (0.33) mag or $\times0.83 (0.74)$. These results are consistent with $z<0.2$ studies while our large sample size and area result in smaller Poisson and cosmic variance uncertainties than most $z >0.4$ luminosity and mass function measurements. Using an evolving relation for $K$-band mass to light ratios as a function of $(B-V)$ color, we found a slowly decreasing rate of growth in red galaxy stellar mass density of $\times2.3$ from $z\sim1.1$ to $z\sim0.3$, indicating a slowly decreasing rate of migration from the blue cloud to the red sequence. Unlike some studies of the stellar mass function, we find that massive red galaxies grow by a factor of $\times1.7$ from $z\sim1.1$ to $z\sim0.3$, with the rate of growth due to mergers decreasing with time. These results are comparable with measurements of merger rates and clustering, and they are also consistent with the red galaxy stellar mass growth implied by comparing $K$-band luminosity evolution with the fading of passive stellar population models.},

abstract = {We use a large sample of galaxies from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to calculate galaxy luminosity and stellar mass functions in the local Universe. We estimate k-corrections, evolution corrections, and stellar mass-to-light ratios (M/Ls) by fitting the galaxy colors with simple models. Our optical and near-infrared luminosity functions agree with most recent literature optical and near-infrared determinations within the uncertainties. We argue that 2MASS is biased against low surface brightness galaxies, and use SDSS plus our knowledge of stellar populations to estimate that the true K-band luminosity function has a steeper faint end slope than the direct estimate. Assuming a universally-applicable stellar initial mass function (IMF), we derive the stellar mass function of galaxies. The faint end slope slope for the stellar mass function is steeper than -1.1, reflecting the low stellar M/Ls characteristic of low-mass galaxies. We estimate an upper limit to the stellar mass density in the local Universe Omega* h = 0.0020+/-0.0006 by assuming an IMF as rich in low-mass stars as allowed by observations of galaxy dynamics. Finally, we find that the characteristic luminosity or mass of early-type galaxies is larger than for later types, and the faint end slope is steeper for later types than for earlier types. Accounting for typing uncertainties, we estimate that at least half, and perhaps as much as 3/4, of the stellar mass in the Universe is in early-type galaxies. We present also SDSS/2MASS color-M/L correlations, an updated discussion of near-infrared stellar M/L estimates, and the volume-corrected distribution of g and K-band stellar M/Ls as a function of stellar mass.

abstract = {We calculate the projected two point correlation function for samples of luminous and massive galaxies in the COMBO-17 photometric redshift survey, focusing particularly on the amplitude of the correlation function at small projected radii and exploring the constraints such measurements can place on the galaxy merger rate. For nearly volume-limited samples with 0.4<z<0.8, we find that 4+/-1% of luminous M_B<-20 galaxies are in close physical pairs (with real space separation of <30 proper kpc). The corresponding fraction for massive galaxies with M_*>2.5e10 M_sun is 5+/-1%. Incorporating close pair fractions from the literature, the 2dFGRS and the SDSS, we find a fairly rapid evolution of the merger fraction of massive galaxies between z=0.8 and the present day. Assuming that the major merger timescale is of order the dynamical timescale for close massive galaxy pairs, we tentatively infer that $\sim$50% (70%) of all galaxies with present-day masses M_*>5e10 M_sun (remnants of mergers between galaxies with M_*>2.5e10 M_sun) have undergone a major merger since z=0.8(1): major mergers between massive galaxies are a significant driver of galaxy evolution over the last eight billion years.},

abstract = {The study of short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) experienced a complete revolution in recent years thanks to the discovery of the first afterglows and host galaxies starting in May 2005. These observations demonstrated that short GRBs are cosmological in origin, reside in both star forming and elliptical galaxies, are not associated with supernovae, and span a wide isotropic-equivalent energy range of ∼1048-1052erg. However, a fundamental question remains unanswered: What are the progenitors of short GRBs? The most popular theoretical model invokes the coalescence of compact object binaries with neutron star and/or black hole constituents. However, additional possibilities exist, including magnetars formed through prompt channels (massive star core-collapse) and delayed channels (binary white dwarf mergers, white dwarf accretion-induced collapse), or accretion-induced collapse of neutron stars. In this review I summarize our current knowledge of the galactic and sub-galactic environments of short GRBs, and use these observations to draw inferences about the progenitor population. The most crucial results are: (i) some short GRBs explode in dead elliptical galaxies; (ii) the majority of short GRBs occur in star forming galaxies; (iii) the star forming hosts of short GRBs are distinct from those of long GRBs, and instead appear to be drawn from the general field galaxy population; (iv) the physical offsets of short GRBs relative to their host galaxy centers are significantly larger than for long GRBs; (v) there is tentative evidence for large offsets from short GRBs with optical afterglows and no coincident hosts; (vi) the observed offset distribution is in good agreement with predictions for NS-NS binary mergers; and (vii) short GRBs trace under-luminous locations within their hosts, but appear to be more closely correlated with the rest-frame optical light (old stars) than the UV light (young massive stars). Taken together, these observations suggest that short GRB progenitors belong to an old stellar population with a wide age distribution, and generally track stellar mass. These results are fully consistent with NS-NS binary mergers and rule out a dominant population of prompt magnetars. However, a partial contribution from delayed magnetar formation or accretion-induced collapse is also consistent with the data. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We have used the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 in combination with ground-based spectroscopy to measure the integrated flux of galaxies at optical wavelengths - the extragalactic background light (EBL). We have also computed the integrated light from individual galaxy counts in the images used to measure the EBL and in the Hubble Deep Field. We find that flux in galaxies as measured by standard galaxy photometry methods has generally been underestimated by about 50%, resulting from missed flux in the outer, lower surface brightness parts of galaxies and from associated errors in the estimated sky level. Comparing the corrected, integrated flux from individual galaxies with our total EBL measurement, we find that there is yet further light that contributes to the background that is not represented by galaxy counts and that the total flux in individually detected sources is a factor of 2-3 less than the EBL from 8000 to 3000 {\AA}. We show that a significant fraction of the EBL may come from normal galaxies at z < 4, which are simply undetectable as a result of K-corrections and cosmological surface brightness dimming. This result is consistent with results from recent redshift surveys at z < 4. In the context of some simple models, we discuss the constraints placed by the EBL on evolution in the luminosity density at z > 1; while significant flux comes from galaxies beyond the current detection limits, this evolution cannot be tightly constrained by our data. Based on our measurements of the optical EBL, combined with previously published measurements of the UV and IR EBL, we estimate that the total EBL from 0.1 to 1000 $\mu$m is 100 ± 20 nW m-2sr-1. If the total EBL were produced entirely by stellar nucleosynthesis, then we estimate that the total baryonic mass processed through stars is $\Omega$* = 0.0062(±0.0022) h-2in units of the critical density. For currently favored values of the baryon density $\Omega$Bthis corresponds to 0.33 ± 0.12$\Omega$B. This estimate is smaller by roughly 7% if we allow for a contribution of 7 h0.7nW m-2sr-1to the total EBL from accretion onto central black holes. This estimate of $\Omega$* suggests that the universe has been enriched to a total metal mass of 0.21 (±0.13) Z⊙$\Omega$B, which is consistent with other observational estimates of the cumulative metal mass fraction of stars, stellar remnants, and the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters in the local universe.},

The data set includes several low-redshift samples (z<0.1), all 3 seasons from the SDSS-II (0.05 < z < 0.4), and 3 years from SNLS (0.2 <z < 1) and totals \ntotc spectroscopically confirmed type Ia supernovae with high quality light curves. We have followed the methods and assumptions of the SNLS 3-year data analysis except for the following important improvements: 1) the addition of the full SDSS-II spectroscopically-confirmed SN Ia sample in both the training of the SALT2 light curve model and in the Hubble diagram analysis (\nsdssc SNe), 2) inter-calibration of the SNLS and SDSS surveys and reduced systematic uncertainties in the photometric calibration, performed blindly with respect to the cosmology analysis, and 3) a thorough investigation of systematic errors associated with the SALT2 modeling of SN Ia light-curves. We produce recalibrated SN Ia light-curves and associated distances for the SDSS-II and SNLS samples. The large SDSS-II sample provides an effective, independent, low-z anchor for the Hubble diagram and reduces the systematic error from calibration systematics in the low-z SN sample. For a flat LCDM cosmology we find Omega_m=0.295+-0.034 (stat+sys), a value consistent with the most recent CMB measurement from the Planck and WMAP experiments. Our result is 1.8sigma (stat+sys) different than the previously published result of SNLS 3-year data. The change is due primarily to improvements in the SNLS photometric calibration. When combined with CMB constraints, we measure a constant dark-energy equation of state parameter w=-1.018+-0.057 (stat+sys) for a flat universe. Adding BAO distance measurements gives similar constraints: w=-1.027+-0.055.},

abstract = {We study the motion of dust grains into the intergalactic medium (IGM) around redshift z = 3, to test the hypothesis that grains can efficiently pollute the gas with metals through sputtering. We use the results available in the literature for radiation-driven dust ejection from galaxies as initial conditions and follow the motion onwards. Via this mechanism, grains are ejected into the IGM with velocities 99> 100 km s-1; as they move supersonically, grains can be efficiently eroded by non-thermal sputtering. However, Coulomb and collisional drag forces effectively reduce the charged grain velocity. Up-to-date sputtering yields for graphite and silicate (olivine) grains have been derived using the code TRANSPORT OF IONS IN MATTER (TRIM), for which we provide analytic fits. After training our method on a homogeneous density case, we analyse the grain motion and sputtering in the IGM density field as derived from a A cold dark matter (CDM) cosmological simulation at z = 3.27. We found that only large (a ≳ 0.1 $\mu$m) grains can travel up to considerable distances (few × 100 kpc physical) before being stopped. Resulting metallicities show a well-defined trend with overdensity 5. The maximum metallicities are reached for 10 < $\delta$ < 100 [corresponding to systems, in quasi-stellar object (QSO) absorption spectra, with 14.5 < log N(HI) < 16]. However the distribution of sputtered metals is very inhomogeneous, with only a small fraction of the IGM volume polluted by dust sputtering (filling factors of 18 per cent for Si and 6 per cent for C). For the adopted size distribution, grains are never completely destroyed; nevertheless, the extinction and gas photoelectric heating effects resulting from this population of intergalactic grains are well below current detection limits. {\textcopyright} 2005 RAS.},

We determine the LGRB host populations under different thresholds for the LGRB progenitor metallicities, according to the collapsar model. We compare the simulated sample of LGRBs hosts with recent, largely unbiased, host samples: BAT6 and SHOALS. We find that at $z<1$ simulated hosts follow the mass-metallicity relation and the fundamental metallicity relation simultaneously, but with a paucity of high-metallicity hosts, in accordance with observations. We also find a clear increment in the mean stellar mass of LGRB hosts and their SFR with redshift up to $z<3$ on account of the metallicity dependence of progenitors. We explore the possible origin of LGRBs in metal rich galaxies, and find that the intrinsic metallicity dispersion in galaxies could explain their presence. LGRB hosts present a tighter correlation between galaxy metallicity and internal metallicity dispersion compared to normal star forming galaxies. We find that the Illustris simulations favours the existence of a metallicity threshold for LGRB progenitors in the range 0.3 - 0.6 Z$_\odot$},

abstract = {We investigate the conditions for the existence of an expanding virial shock in the gas falling within a spherical dark-matter halo. The shock relies on pressure support by the shock-heated gas behind it. When the radiative cooling is efficient compared to the infall rate the post-shock gas becomes unstable; it collapses inwards and cannot support the shock. We find for a monoatomic gas that the shock is stable when the post-shock pressure and density obey gamma effective>10/7, with gamma effective begin the time depended equivalent to the adiabatic index. We express the effective gamma in terms of r, u and rho at the shock to obtain a simple condition for shock stability. This result is confirmed by hydrodynamical simulations, using an accurate spheri-symmetric Lagrangian code. When the stability analysis is applied in cosmology, we find that a virial shock does not develop in most haloes that form before z $\sim$ 2, and it never forms in haloes less massive than a few 10^11 solar masses. In such haloes the infalling gas is never heated to the virial temperature, and it does not need to cool radiatively before it drops into a disc. Instead, the gas collapses at T $\sim$ 10^4K directly into the disc. This should have nontrivial effects on the star-formation rate and on the gas removal by supernova-driven winds. Instead of radiating soft x rays, this gas would emit lyman alpha thus helping explain the low flux of soft x-ray background and the lyman alpha emitters observed at high redshift.},

We present the MeerLICHT and BlackGEM telescopes, which are wide-field optical telescopes that are currently being built to study transient phenomena, gravitational wave counterparts and variable stars. The telescopes have 65 cm primary mirrors and a 2.7 square degree field-of-view. The MeerLICHT and BlackGEM projects have different science goals, but will use identical telescopes. The first telescope, MeerLICHT, will be commissioned at Sutherland (South Africa) in the first quarter of 2017. It will co-point with MeerKAT to collect optical data commensurate with the radio observations. After careful analysis of MeerLICHT's performance, three telescopes of the same type will be commissioned in La Silla (Chile) in 2018 to form phase I of the BlackGEM array. BlackGEM aims at detecting and characterizing optical counterparts of gravitational wave events detected by Advanced LIGO and Virgo. In this contribution we present an overview of the science goals, the design and the status of the two projects.},

@article{Bolmer2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} ESO, 2018. Context. Dust is known to be produced in the envelopes of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, the expanded shells of supernova (SN) remnants, and in situ grain growth within the interstellar medium (ISM), although the corresponding efficiency of each of these dust formation mechanisms at different redshifts remains a topic of debate. During the first Gyr after the Big Bang, it is widely believed that there was not enough time to form AGB stars in high numbers, hence the dust at this epoch is expected to be purely from SNe or subsequent grain growth in the ISM. The time period corresponding to z $\sim$ 5-6 is thus expected to display the transition from SN-only dust to a mixture of both formation channels as is generally recognized at present. Aims. Here we aim to use afterglow observations of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) at redshifts larger than z  >  4 to derive host galaxy dust column densities along their line of sight and to test if a SN-type dust extinction curve is required for some of the bursts. Methods. We performed GRB afterglow observations with the seven-channel Gamma-Ray Optical and Near-infrared Detector (GROND) at the 2.2 m MPI telescope in La Silla, Chile (ESO), and we combined these observations with quasi-simultaneous data gathered with the XRT telescope on board the Swift satellite. Results. We increase the number of measured A V values for GRBs at z  >  4 by a factor of $\sim$2-3 and find that, in contrast to samples at mostly lower redshift, all of the GRB afterglows have a visual extinction of A V <  0.5 mag. Analysis of the GROND detection thresholds and results from a Monte Carlo simulation show that although we partly suffer from an observational bias against highly extinguished sight-lines, GRB host galaxies at 4  <  z  <  6 seem to contain on average less dust than at z $\sim$ 2. Additionally, we find that all of the GRBs can be modeled with locally measured extinction curves and that the SN-like dust extinction curve, as previously found toward GRB 071025, provides a better fit for only two of the afterglow SEDs. However, because of the lack of highly extinguished sight lines and the limited wavelength coverage we cannot distinguish between the different scenarios. For the first time we also report a photometric redshift of z phot = 7.88 -0.94 +0.75 for GRB 100905A, making it one of the most distant GRBs known to date.},

We detect seven intervening systems at z > 5.5, with the highest-redshift system being a C IV absorber at z = 6.51. We find tentative evidence that the mass density of C IV remains flat or declines with redshift at z < 6, while the number density of C II systems remains relatively flat over 5 < z < 7. These trends are broadly consistent with models of chemical enrichment by star formation-driven winds that include a softening of the ultraviolet background towards higher redshifts. We find a larger number of weak (W rest < 0. A) Mg II systems over 5.9 < z < 7.0 than predicted by a power-law fit to the number density of stronger systems. This is consistent with trends in the number density of weak Mg II systems at z 2.5, and suggests that the mechanisms that create these absorbers are already in place at z ∼ 7. Finally, we investigate the associated narrow Si IV, C IV, and N V absorbers located near the QSO redshift, and find that at least one component shows evidence of partial covering of the continuum source.},

abstract = {Galaxies are thought to be fed by the continuous accretion of intergalactic gas, but direct observational evidence has been elusive. The accreted gas is expected to orbit about the galaxy's halo, delivering not just fuel for star formation but also angular momentum to the galaxy, leading to distinct kinematic signatures. We report observations showing these distinct signatures near a typical distant star-forming galaxy, where the gas is detected using a background quasar passing 26 kiloparsecs from the host. Our observations indicate that gas accretion plays a major role in galaxy growth because the estimated accretion rate is comparable to the star-formation rate.},

abstract = {[Abridged] We revisit the metal budget at z$\sim$2. In the first two papers of this series, we already showed that $\sim$30% (to <60% if extrapolating the LF) of the metals are observed in all z$\sim$2.5 galaxies detected in current surveys. Here, we extend our analysis to the metals outside galaxies, i.e. in intergalactic medium (IGM), using observational data and analytical calculations. Our results for the two are strikingly similar: (1) Observationally, we find that, besides the small (5%) contribution of DLAs, the forest and sub-DLAs contribute subtantially to make <30--45% of the metal budget, but neither of these appear to be sufficient to close the metal budget. The forest accounts for 15--30% depending on the UV background, and sub-DLAs for >2% to <17% depending on the ionization fraction. Together, the `missing metals' problem is substantially eased. (2) We perform analytical calculations based on the effective yield--mass relation. At z=2, we find that the method predicts that 2$--50% of the metals have been ejected from galaxies into the IGM, consistent with the observations. The metal ejection is predominantly by L<1/3L_B^*(z=2) galaxies, which are responsible for 90% the metal enrichment, while the 50 percentile is at L\sim1/10L^*_B(z=2). As a consequence, if indeed 50% of the metals have been ejected from galaxies, 3--5 bursts of star formation are required per galaxy prior to z=2. The ratio between the mass of metals outside galaxies to those in stars has changed from z=2 to z=0: it was 2:1 or 1:1 and is now 1:8 or 1:9. This evolution implies that a significant fraction of the IGM metals will cool and fall back into galaxies.},

abstract = {This lecture reviews the fundamental physical processes involved in star formation in galaxy interactions and mergers. Interactions and mergers often drive intense starbursts, but the link between interstellar gas physics, large scale interactions, and active star formation is complex and not fully understood yet. Two processes can drive starbursts: radial inflows of gas can fuel nuclear starbursts, triggered gas turbulence and fragmentation can drive more extended starbursts in massive star clusters with high fractions of dense gas. Both modes are certainly required to account for the observed properties of starbursting mergers. A particular consequence is that star formation scaling laws are not universal, but vary from quiescent disks to starbursting mergers. High-resolution hydrodynamic simulations are used to illustrate the lectures.},

abstract = {We present a comprehensive study of the physical properties of ∼ 105 galaxies with measurable star formation in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). By comparing physical information extracted from the emission lines with continuum properties, we build up a picture of the nature of star-forming galaxies at z < 0.2. We develop a method for aperture correction using resolved imaging and show that our method takes out essentially all aperture bias in the star formation rate (SFR) estimates, allowing an accurate estimate of the total SFRs in galaxies. We determine the SFR density to be 1.915-0.01+0.02 (random)-0.42+0.14 (systematic) h70l0-2 M⊙ yr-1 Mpc-3 at z = 0.1 (for a Kroupa initial mass function) and we study the distribution of star formation as a function of various physical parameters. The majority of the star formation in the low-redshift Universe takes place in moderately massive galaxies (10100-1011 M ⊙), typically in high surface brightness disc galaxies. Roughly 15 per cent of all star formation takes place in galaxies that show some sign of an active nucleus. About 20 per cent occurs in starburst galaxies. By focusing on the SFR per unit mass we show that the present to past average SFR, the Scalo b-parameter, is almost constant over almost three orders of magnitude in mass, declining only at M* > 1010 M⊙. The volume averaged b parameter is 0.408-0.002+0.005 (random) -0.090+0.029 (systematic)h70-1. We use this value to constrain the star formation history of the Universe. For the concordance cosmology the present-day Universe is forming stars at at least 1/3 of its past average rate. For an exponentially declining cosmic star formation history this corresponds to a time-scale of 7-1.5-0.7 Gyr. In agreement with other work we find a correlation between b and morphological type, as well as a tight correlation between the 4000-{\AA} break (D4000) and b. We discuss how D4000 can be used to estimate b parameters for high-redshift galaxies.},

We combine the DES-SN sample with an external sample of 122 low-redshift ($z$<0.1) SNe Ia, resulting in a "DES-SN3YR" sample of 329 SNe Ia. Our cosmological analyses are blinded: after combining our DES-SN3YR distances with constraints from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB; Planck Collaboration 2016), our uncertainties in the measurement of the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, $w$, are .042 (stat) and .059 (stat+syst) at 68% confidence. We provide a detailed systematic uncertainty budget, which has nearly equal contributions from photometric calibration, astrophysical bias corrections, and instrumental bias corrections. We also include several new sources of systematic uncertainty. While our sample is <1/3 the size of the Pantheon sample, our constraints on $w$ are only larger by 1.4$\times$, showing the impact of the DES SN Ia light curve quality. We find that the traditional stretch and color standardization parameters of the DES SNe Ia are in agreement with earlier SN Ia samples such as Pan-STARRS1 and the Supernova Legacy Survey. However, we find smaller intrinsic scatter about the Hubble diagram (0.077 mag). Interestingly, we find no evidence for a Hubble residual step ( 0.007 $\pm$ 0.018 mag) as a function of host galaxy mass for the DES subset, in 2.4$\sigma$ tension with previous measurements. We also present novel validation methods of our sample using simulated SNe Ia inserted in DECam images and using large catalog-level simulations to test for biases in our analysis pipelines.},

abstract = {We present a new model for computing the spectral evolution of stellar populations at ages between 1 × 105 and 2 × 10 10 yr at a resolution of 3 {\AA} across the whole wavelength range from 3200 to 9500 {\AA} for a wide range of metallicities. These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 {\AA} to 160 $\mu$m, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.},

abstract = {We present a measurement of the deuterium to hydrogen ratio (D/H) in a metal-poor absorption system at redshift z = 2.504 toward the QSO 1009+2956. We apply the new method of Burles & Tytler to robustly determine D/H in high-resolution Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra and include a constraint on the neutral hydrogen column density determined from the Lyman continuum optical depth in low-resolution spectra. We introduce six separate models to measure D/H and to assess the systematic dependence on the assumed underlying parameters. We find that the deuterium absorption feature contains a small amount of contamination from unrelated H I. Including the effects of the contamination, we calculate the 67% confidence interval of D/H in this absorption system, log (D/H)=-4.40+0.06-0.08. This measurement agrees with the low measurement by Burles & Tytler toward Q1937-1009, and the combined value gives the best determination of primordial D/H, log (D/H)p=-4.47+0.030-0.035 or D/H = 3.39 +/- 0.25 × 10-5. Predictions from standard big bang nucleosynthesis give the cosmological baryon-to-photon ratio, $\eta$ = 5.1 +/- 0.3 × 10-10, and the baryon density in units of the critical density, $\Omega$bh2 = 0.019 +/- 0.001, where H0 = 100h km s-1 Mpc-1. The measured value of (D/H)p implies that the primordial abundances of both 4He and 7Li are high and consistent with some recent studies. Our two low measurements of primordial D/H also place strong constraints on inhomogeneous models of big bang nucleosynthesis.},

abstract = {The Swift Gamma-Ray Explorer is designed to make prompt multiwavelength observations of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) and GRB afterglows. The X-ray Telescope (XRT) enables Swift to determine GRB positions with a few arcseconds accuracy within 100 seconds of the burst onset. The XRT utilizes a mirror set built for JET-X and an XMM/EPIC MOS CCD detector to provide a sensitive broad-band (0.2-10 keV) X-ray imager with effective area of > 120 cm^2 at 1.5 keV, field of view of 23.6 x 23.6 arcminutes, and angular resolution of 18 arcseconds (HPD). The detection sensitivity is 2x10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in 10^4 seconds. The instrument is designed to provide automated source detection and position reporting within 5 seconds of target acquisition. It can also measure the redshifts of GRBs with Fe line emission or other spectral features. The XRT operates in an auto-exposure mode, adjusting the CCD readout mode automatically to optimize the science return for each frame as the source intensity fades. The XRT will measure spectra and lightcurves of the GRB afterglow beginning about a minute after the burst and will follow each burst for days or weeks.},

The XRT covers the 0.2-10 keV band, and spends most of its time observing gamma-ray burst (GRB)afterglows, though it has also performed observations of many other objects. By mid-August 2007, the XRT had observed over 220 GRB afterglows, detecting about 96% of them. The XRT positions enable followup ground-based optical observations, with roughly 60% of the afterglows detected at optical or near IR wavelengths. Redshifts are measured for 33% of X-ray afterglows. Science highlights include the discovery of flaring behavior at quite late times, with implications for GRB central engines; localization of short GRBs, leading to observational support for compact merger progenitors for this class of bursts; a mysterious plateau phase to GRB afterglows; as well as many other interesting observations such as X-ray emission from comets, novae, galactic transients, and other objects.},

abstract = {We calculate durations and spectral paramaters for 218 Swift bursts detected by the BAT instrument between and including GRBs 041220 and 070509, including 77 events with measured redshifts. Incorporating prior knowledge into the spectral fits, we are able to measure the characteristic $\nu F_{\nu}$ spectral peak energy $E_{\rm pk,obs}$ and the isotropic equivalent energy $E_{\rm iso}$ (1--$10^4$ keV) for all events. This complete and rather extensive catalog, analyzed with a unified methodology, allows us to address the persistence and origin of high-energy correlations suggested in pre-Swift observations. We find that the $E_{\rm pk,obs}$-$E_{\rm iso}$ correlation is present in the Swift sample; however, the best-fit powerlaw relation is inconsistent with the best-fit pre-Swift relation at >5 sigma significance. Moreover, it has a factor >$\sim$ 2 larger intrinsic scatter, after accounting for large errors on $E_{\rm pk,obs}$. A large fraction of the Swift events are hard and subluminous relative to (and inconsistent with) the pre-Swift relation, in agreement with indications from BATSE GRBs without redshift. Moreover, we determine an experimental threshold for the BAT detector and show how the $E_{\rm pk,obs}$--$E_{\rm iso}$ correlation arises artificially due to partial correlation with the threshold. We show that pre-Swift correlations found by Amati et al.(2002), Yonetoku et al. (2004), Firmani et al.(2006) (and independently by others) are likely unrelated to the physical properties of GRBs and are likely useless for tests of cosmology. Also, an explanation of these correlations in terms of a detector threshold provides a natural and quantitative explanation for why short-duration GRBs and events at low redshift tend to be outliers to the correlations.},

The key to demystifying FRBs lies in discovering many of them in order to identity commonalities – and in real time, in order to find potential counterparts at other wavelengths. The recently upgraded UTMOST in Australia, is undergoing a backend transformation to rise as a fast transient detection machine. The first interferometric detections of FRBs with UTMOST, place their origin beyond the near-field region of the telescope thus ruling out local sources of interference as a possible origin. We have localised these bursts to much better than the ones discovered at the Parkes radio telescope and have plans to upgrade UTMOST to be capable of much better localisation still.},

abstract = {We examine the pairing process of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) down to scales of 20-100 pc using a set of N-body/SPH simulations of binary mergers of disk galaxies with mass ratios of 1:4 and 1:10. Our numerical experiments are designed to represent merger events occurring at various cosmic epochs. The initial conditions of the encounters are consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm of structure formation, and the simulations include the effects of radiative cooling, star formation (SF), and supernovae feedback. We find that the pairing of SMBHs depends sensitively on the amount of baryonic mass preserved in the center of the companion galaxies during the last phases of the merger. In particular, due to the combination of gasdynamics and SF, we find that a pair of SMBHs can form efficiently in 1:10 minor mergers, provided that galaxies are relatively gas-rich (gas fractions of 30% of the disk mass) and that the mergers occur at relatively high redshift (z $\sim$ 3), when dynamical friction timescales are shorter. Since 1:10 mergers are most common events during the assembly of galaxies, and mergers are more frequent at high redshift when galaxies are also more gas-rich, our results have positive implications for future gravitational wave experiments such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.},

abstract = {Long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are associated with the explosion of massive stars in star-forming regions. A large fraction of GRBs show intrinsic absorption as detected in optical spectra but absorption signatures are also detectable in the afterglow X-ray spectra. We present here a comprehensive analysis of the full sample of 93 GRBs with known redshift promptly observed by the Swift X-Ray Telescope (XRT) up to 2009 June. The distribution of X-ray column densities clearly shows that GRBs are heavily absorbed indicating that they indeed occur in dense environments. Furthermore, there is a lack of heavily absorbed GRBs at low redshift (z <$\sim$ 1-2) that might therefore be candidates for the missing `dark' GRB population. However, there is no statistically significant correlation between the amount of X-ray absorption and the `darkness' of a GRB. Finally, we compare the hydrogen column densities derived in the optical with those derived from X-ray absorption. The two distributions are different, with the optical column densities being lower than the X-ray ones, which is even more apparent when correcting for metallicity effects. The most likely explanation is photoionization of hydrogen in the circumburst material caused by the radiation field of the burst.},

For GRB 130215A/SN 2013ez, we also present optical spectroscopy at t - t0 = 16.1 d, which covers rest-frame 3000-6250 {\AA}. Based on Fe ii $\lambda$5169 and Si ii $\lambda$6355, our spectrum indicates an unusually low expansion velocity of $\sim$4000-6350 km s-1, the lowest ever measured for a GRB-SN. Additionally, we determined the brightness and shape of each accompanying SN relative to a template supernova (SN 1998bw), which were used to estimate the amount of nickel produced via nucleosynthesis during each explosion. We find that our derived nickel masses are typical of other GRB-SNe, and greater than those of SNe Ibc that are not associated with GRBs. For GRB 130831A/SN 2013fu, we used our well-sampled R-band light curve (LC) to estimate the amount of ejecta mass and the kinetic energy of the SN, finding that these too are similar to other GRB-SNe. For GRB 130215A, we took advantage of contemporaneous optical/NIR observations to construct an optical/NIR bolometric LC of the afterglow. We fit the bolometric LC with the millisecond magnetar model of Zhang & M{\'{e}}sz{\'{a}}ros (2001, ApJ, 552, L35), which considers dipole radiation as a source of energy injection to the forward shock powering the optical/NIR afterglow. Using this model we derive an initial spin period of P = 12 ms and a magnetic field of B = 1.1 × 1015 G, which are commensurate with those found for proposed magnetar central engines of other long-duration GRBs.

abstract = {We present an analytical model that considers energy arising from a magnetar central engine. The results of fitting this model to the optical and X-ray light curves (LCs) of five long-duration $\gamma$-ray bursts (LGRBs) and two ultra-long GRBs (ULGRBs), including their associated supernovae (SNe), show that emission from a magnetar central engine cannot be solely responsible for powering an LGRB-SN. While the early AG-dominated phase can be well described with our model, the predicted SN luminosity is underluminous by a factor of $3-17$. We use this as compelling evidence that additional sources of heating must be present to power an LGRB-SN, which we argue must be radioactive heating. Our self-consistent modelling approach was able to successfully describe all phases of ULGRB 111209A / SN 2011kl, from the early afterglow to the later SN, where we determined for the magnetar central engine a magnetic field strength of $1.1-1.3\times10^{15}$ G, an initial spin period of $11.5-13.0$ ms, a spin-down time of $4.8-6.5$ d, and an initial energy of $1.2-1.6\times10^{50}$ erg. These values are entirely consistent with those determined by other authors. The luminosity of a magnetar-powered SN is directly related to how long the central engine is active, where central engines with longer durations give rise to brighter SNe. The spin-down timescales of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are of order months to years, which provides a natural explanation as to why SN 2011kl was less luminous than SLSNe that are also powered by emission from magnetar central engines.},

abstract = {We present a detailed report of the connection between long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and their accompanying supernovae (SNe). The discussion presented here places emphasis on how observations, and the modelling of observations, have constrained what we know about GRB-SNe. We discuss their photometric and spectroscopic properties, their role as cosmological probes, including their measured luminosity–decline relationships, and how they can be used to measure the Hubble constant. We present a statistical summary of their bolometric properties and use this to determine the properties of the “average” GRB-SN. We discuss their geometry and consider the various physical processes that are thought to power the luminosity of GRB-SNe and whether differences exist between GRB-SNe and the SNe associated with ultra-long-duration GRBs. We discuss how observations of their environments further constrain the physical properties of their progenitor stars and give a brief overview of the current theoretical paradigms of their central engines. We then present an overview of the radioactively powered transients that have been photometrically associated with short-duration GRBs, and we conclude by discussing what additional research is needed to further our understanding of GRB-SNe, in particular the role of binary-formation channels and the connection of GRB-SNe with superluminous SNe.},

abstract = {Simulations of structure formation in the Universe predict that galaxies are embedded in a "cosmic web", where the majority of baryons reside as rarefied and highly ionized gas. This material has been studied for decades in absorption against background sources, but the sparseness of these inherently one-dimensional probes preclude direct constraints on the three-dimensional morphology of the underlying web. Here we report observations of a cosmic web filament in Lyman-alpha emission, discovered during a survey for cosmic gas fluorescently "illuminated" by bright quasars at z=2.3. With a projected size of approximately 460 physical kpc, the Lyman-alpha emission surrounding the radio-quiet quasar UM287 extends well beyond the virial radius of any plausible associated dark matter halo. The estimated cold gas mass of the nebula from the observed emission is at least ten times larger than what is typically found by cosmological simulations, suggesting that a population of intergalactic gas clumps with sub-kpc sizes may be missing within current numerical models.},

@article{Cappellari2017,
abstract = {I start by providing an updated summary of the penalized pixel-fitting (PPXF) method that is used to extract the stellar and gas kinematics, as well as the stellar population of galaxies, via full spectrum fitting. I then focus on the problem of extracting the kinematics when the velocity dispersion s is smaller than the velocity sampling $\Delta$V that is generally, by design, close to the instrumental dispersion $\sigma$inst. The standard approach consists of convolving templates with a discretized kernel, while fitting for its parameters. This is obviously very inaccurate when $\sigma$≲ $\Delta$V /2, due to undersampling. Oversampling can prevent this, but it has drawbacks. Here I present a more accurate and efficient alternative. It avoids the evaluation of the undersampled kernel and instead directly computes its well-sampled analytic Fourier transform, for use with the convolution theorem. A simple analytic transform exists when the kernel is described by the popular Gauss-Hermite parametrization (which includes the Gaussian as special case) for the line-of-sight velocity distribution. I describe how this idea was implemented in a significant upgrade to the publicly available PPXF software. The key advantage of the new approach is that it provides accurate velocities regardless of $\sigma$. This is important e.g. for spectroscopic surveys targeting galaxies with $\sigma$ ≪$\sigma$inst, for galaxy redshift determinations or for measuring line-of-sight velocities of individual stars. The proposed method could also be used to fix Gaussian convolution algorithms used in today's popular software packages.},

@article{Carniani,
abstract = {We present new ALMA observations of the [OIII]88$\mu$m line and high angular resolution observations of the [CII]158$\mu$m line in a normal star forming galaxy at z$=$7.1. Previous [CII] observations of this galaxy had detected [CII] emission consistent with the Ly$\alpha$ redshift but spatially slightly offset relative to the optical (UV-rest frame) emission. The new [CII] observations reveal that the [CII] emission is partly clumpy and partly diffuse on scales larger than about 1kpc. [OIII] emission is also detected at high significance, offset relative to the optical counterpart in the same direction as the [CII] clumps, but mostly not overlapping with the bulk of the [CII] emission. The offset between different emission components (optical/UV and different far-IR tracers) is similar to what observed in much more powerful starbursts at high redshift. We show that the [OIII] emitting clump cannot be explained in terms of diffuse gas excited by the UV radiation emitted by the optical galaxy, but it requires excitation by in-situ (slightly dust obscured) star formation, at a rate of about 7 M$_{\odot}$/yr. Within 20 kpc from the optical galaxy the ALMA data reveal two additional [OIII] emitting systems, which must be star forming companions. We discuss that the complex properties revealed by ALMA in the z$\sim$7.1 galaxy are consistent with expectations by recent models and cosmological simulations, in which differential dust extinction, differential excitation and different metal enrichment levels, associated with different subsystems assembling a galaxy, are responsible for the different appearance of the system when observed with different tracers.},

With the goal of making the latest atomic data accessible to the community, we present a compilation of selected atomic data for resonant absorption lines at wavelengths longward of 911.75 A (the H I Lyman limit), for key heavy elements (heavier than atomic number 5) of astrophysical interest. In particular, we focus on the transitions of those ions that have been observed in the Milky Way interstellar medium (ISM), the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the Milky Way and/or other galaxies, and the intergalactic medium (IGM). We provide wavelengths, oscillator strengths (both previous and new deter-minations, where available), associated accuracy grades, and references to the oscillator strength determinations. We also attempt to compare and assess the recent oscillator strength determinations. For about 22% of the lines that have updated oscillator strength values, the differences between the former values and the updated ones are 0.1 dex. Our compilation will be a useful resource for absorption line studies of the ISM, as well as studies of the CGM and IGM traced by sight lines to quasars and gamma-ray bursts. Studies (including those enabled by future generations of extremely large telescopes) of absorption by galaxies against the light of back-ground galaxies will also benefit from our compilation.},

abstract = {Aims. We present multiwavelength (X-ray/optical/near-infrared/millimetre) observations of GRB 051022 between 2.5 h and ∼ 1.15 yr after the event. It is the most intense gamma-ray burst (∼10-4 erg cm-2) detected by HETE-2, with the exception of the nearby GRB 030329. Methods. Optical and near infrared observations did not detect the afterglow despite a strong afterglow at X-ray wavelengths. Millimetre observations at Plateau de Bure (PdB) detected a source and a flare, confirming the association of this event with a moderately bright (R = 21.5) galaxy. Results. Spectroscopic observations of this galaxy show strong [O II], H$\beta$ and [O III] emission lines at a redshift of 0.809. The spectral energy distribution (SED) of the galaxy implies Av (rest frame) =1.0 and a starburst occuring ∼25 Myr ago, during which the star-forming-rate reached ∼50 M ⊙/yr. In conjunction with the spatial extent (∼1) it suggests a very luminous (Mv = -21.8) blue compact galaxy, for which we also find Z ∼ Z0. The X-ray spectrum shows evidence of considerable absorption by neutral gas with NH,X-ray = 3.47 -0.47+4.48; × 1022 cnr-2 (rest frame). Absorption by dust in the host galaxy at z = 0.809 certainly cannot account for the non-detection of the optical afterglow, unless the dust-to-gas ratio is quite different than that seen in our Galaxy (i.e. large dust grains). Conclusions. It is likely that the afterglow of the dark GRB 051022 was extinguished along the line of sight by an obscured, dense star forming region in a molecular cloud within the parent host galaxy. This galaxy is different from most GRB hosts being brighter than L* by a factor of 3. We have also derived a SFR ∼ 50 M⊙/yr and predict that this host galaxy will be detected at sub-mm wavelengths. {\textcopyright} ESO 2007.},

abstract = {We present multicolor optical observations of long-duration $\gamma$ -ray bursts (GRBs) made over a three-year period with the robotic Palomar 60 inch telescope (P60). Our sample consists of all 29 events discovered by Swift for which P60 began observations less than 1 hr after the burst trigger. We were able to recover 80% of the optical afterglows from this prompt sample, and we attribute this high efficiency to our red coverage. Like Melandri et al. (2008), we find that a significant fraction (≈ 50%) of Swift events show a suppression of the optical flux with regard to the X-ray emission (the so-called " dark " bursts). Our multicolor photometry demonstrates this is likely due in large part to extinction in the host galaxy. We argue that previous studies, by selecting only the brightest and best-sampled optical afterglows, have significantly underestimated the amount of dust present in typical GRB environments. 1. INTRODUCTION The launch of the Swift $\gamma$ -Ray Burst (GRB) Explorer (Gehrels et al. 2004) in 2004 November has ushered in a new era in the study of GRB afterglows. Swift offers a unique combination of event rate (∼100 yr −1 ; almost an order of magnitude increase over previous missions) and precise localization (∼ 3 radius error circles are distributed seconds after the burst, and refined to ∼ 3 minutes later). The onboard X-ray Telescope (XRT; Burrows et al. 2005a) and the UV-Optical Telescope (UVOT; Roming et al. 2005), together with the rapid relay of these precise localizations to ground-based observers, have enabled an unprecedented glimpse into the time period immediately following the prompt emission over a broad frequency range. Observations of X-ray afterglows with the XRT have gener-ated particular interest in recent years. In the pre-Swift era, X-ray observations were limited to hours or days after the prompt emis-sion, and were often poorly sampled compared with the optical and radio bandpasses. Routine XRT observations of Swift GRBs beginning at early times have revealed a central engine capable of injecting energy into the forward shock at times well beyond the duration of the prompt emission (e.g., Burrows et al. 2005b; Zhang et al. 2006). This discovery has had a profound effect on our understanding of progenitor models. While the X-ray afterglow is currently a well-explored phase space, comparatively few analogous studies have been per-formed in the optical bandpass. Berger et al. (2005) first sug-gested that Swift optical afterglows were 1.8 mag fainter in the R band than pre-Swift events (at a common epoch of 12 hr after the burst). Likewise, Roming et al. (2006) found that only six of the first 19 Swift bursts with prompt ($\Delta$t 100 s) UVOT cover-age yielded optical afterglow detections. Since then, explaining the faintness of Swift optical afterglows has remained one of the outstanding questions in the field.},

abstract = {We develop a new realistic prescription for modeling the stellar feedback, which minimizes any ad hoc assumptions about sub-grid physics. We start with developing high resolution models of the ISM and formulate the conditions required for its realistic functionality: formation of multi-phase medium with hot chimneys, super-bubbles, cold molecular phase, and very slow consumption of gas. Another important ingredient is the runaway stars. They greatly facilitate the feedback. Once these effects are implemented into cosmological simulations, we do not have the overcooling problem and the angular momentum problem (resulting in a too massive bulge) is also reduced substantially: the rotation curves are nearly flat. Just as it is often observed in QSO absorption lines, our models produce substantial outflows from forming and active galaxies. At high redshifts we routinely find gas with few hundred km/s and occasionally 1000-2000 km/s. The density profile of dark matter is still consistent with a cuspy profile. The simulations reproduce this picture only if the resolution is very high: better than 50 pc, which is much better than the typical resolution in previous cosmological simulations. Our simulations of galaxy formation reach the resolution of 35 pc. (Abridged)},

abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present day and initial mass functions in various components of the Galaxy, disk, spheroid, young and globular clusters. As a general feature, the IMF is well described by a power-law form for $m\ga 1 \msol$ and a lognormal form below. The extension of the disk IMF into the brown dwarf (BD) regime is in good agreement with observations and yields a disk BD number-density comparable to the stellar one $\sim 0.1 \pc3$. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. Within all the uncertainties, it is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters, and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk. The IMF characteristic of early star formation remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below $\sim 1 \msol$. These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The M/L ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8 and 1.4 smaller than a Salpeter IMF, respectively. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. (shortened)},

This forward-model process can be thought of as a transfer function -- a mapping from cosmological and astronomical signals to the final data products used by the scientists. Using output from the cosmological simulations (the Blind Cosmology Challenge), we generate simulated images (the Ultra Fast Image Simulator, Berge et al. 2013) and catalogs representative of the DES data. In this work we simulate the 244 sq. deg coadd images and catalogs in 5 bands for the DES Science Verification (SV) data. The simulation output is compared with the corresponding data to show that major characteristics of the images and catalogs can be captured. We also point out several directions of future improvements. Two practical examples, star/galaxy classification and proximity effects on object detection, are then used to demonstrate how one can use the simulations to address systematics issues in data analysis. With clear understanding of the simplifications in our model, we show that one can use the simulations side-by-side with data products to interpret the measurements. This forward modelling approach is generally applicable for other upcoming and future surveys. It provides a powerful tool for systematics studies which is sufficiently realistic and highly controllable.},

abstract = {Fast radio bursts 1,2 are astronomical radio flashes of unknown physical nature with durations of milliseconds. Their dispersive arrival times suggest an extragalactic origin and imply radio luminosities that are orders of magnitude larger than those of all known short-duration radio transients 3 . So far all fast radio bursts have been detected with large single-dish telescopes with arcminute localizations, and attempts to identify their counterparts (source or host galaxy) have relied on the contemporaneous variability of field sources 4 or the presence of peculiar field stars 5 or galaxies 4 . These attempts have not resulted in an unambiguous association 6,7 with a host or multi-wavelength counterpart. Here we report the subarcsecond localization of the fast radio burst FRB 121102, the only known repeating burst source 8–11 , using high-time-resolution radio interferometric observations that directly image the bursts. Our precise localization reveals that FRB 121102 originates within 100 milliarcseconds of a faint 180-microJansky persistent radio source with a continuum spectrum that is consistent with non-thermal emission, and a faint (twenty-fifth magnitude) optical counterpart. The flux density of the persistent radio source varies by around ten per cent on day timescales, and very long baseline radio interferometry yields an angular size of less than 1.7 milliarcseconds. Our observations are inconsistent with the fast radio burst having a Galactic origin or its source being located within a prominent star-forming galaxy. Instead, the source appears to be co-located with a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus or a previously unknown type of extragalactic source. Localization and identification of a host or counterpart has been essential to understanding the origins and physics of other kinds of transient events, including gamma-ray bursts 12,13 and tidal disruption events 14 . However, if other fast radio bursts have similarly faint radio and optical counterparts, our findings imply that direct subarcsecond localizations may be the only way to provide reliable associations. The repetition of bursts from FRB 121102 9,10 enabled a targeted interferometric localization campaign with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in concert with single-dish observations using the 305-m William E. Gordon Telescope at the Arecibo Observatory. We searched for bursts in VLA data with 5-ms sampling using both beam-forming and imaging techniques 15 (see Methods). In over 83 h of VLA observations distributed over six months, we detected nine bursts from FRB 121102 in the 2.5–3.5-GHz band with signal-to-noise ratios ranging from 10 to 150, all at a consistent sky position. These bursts were initially detected with real-time de-dispersed imag-ing and confirmed by a beam-formed search (Fig. 1). From these detections, the average J2000 position of the burst source is right ascension $\alpha$ = 05 h 31 min 58.70 s, declination $\delta$ = + 33° 08′ 52.5″ , with a 1$\sigma$ uncertainty of about 0.1″ , consistent with the Arecibo localization 9},

We detected differential absorption in all lenses except SDSS 0924+0219 and HE 1104-1805. This doubles the sample of dust-to-gas ratio measurements in cosmologically distant lens galaxies. We successfully measured the gas phase metallicity of three lenses, Q 2237+0305, SDSS 1004+4112, and B 1152+199 from the X-ray spectra. Our results suggest a linear correlation between metallicity and dust-to-gas ratio (i.e., a constant metal-to-dust ratio), consistent with what is found for nearby galaxies. We obtain an average dust-to-gas ratio $E(B-V)/N_H=1.17^{+0.41}_{-0.31} \times 10^{-22}\rm mag\,cm^2\,atom^{-1}$ in the lens galaxies, with an intrinsic scatter of $\rm0.3\,dex$. Combining these results with data from GRB afterglows and quasar foreground absorbers, we found a mean dust-to-gas ratio $\mdtg,$ now significantly lower than the average Galactic value, $1.7\,\times 10^{-22}\,\rm mag\, cm^{2}\, atoms^{-1}.$ This suggests evolution of dust-to-gas ratios with redshift and lower average metallicities for the higher redshift galaxies, consistent with current metal and dust evolution models of interstellar medium. The slow evolution in the metal-to-dust ratio with redshift implies very rapid dust formation in high redshift ($z>2$) galaxies.},

abstract = {This paper presents near-infrared echellette spectra of faint galaxies in the fields around GRB 050820A at redshift z=2.613 and GRB 060418 at z=1.490. The spectroscopic data show that both GRBs originate in a dynamic environment of interacting galaxies separated by < 15 h^{-1} kpc in projected distance and |dv| <$\sim$ 60 km/s in line-of-sight velocity. The optical afterglows revealed in early-epoch Hubble Space Telescope images are at least 2.5 h^{-1} kpc (or 0.4") away from the high surface brightness regions of the interacting members, indicating that the GRB events occurred either in the outskirts of a compact star-forming galaxy or in a low surface brightness satellite. Comparisons of the systemic redshifts of the host galaxies and the velocity distribution of absorbing clouds revealed in early-time afterglow spectra further show that the majority of the absorbing clouds are redshifted from these compact star-forming galaxies. These include the gas producing fine-structure absorption lines at physical distances d $\sim$ a few x 100 pc from the GRB afterglow. The lack of blueshifted absorbing clouds and the spatial offset of the GRB event from the star-forming regions make it difficult to attribute the observed large velocity spread ($\sim$ 200-400 km/s) of absorbing gas in the GRB host to galactic-scale outflows. We consider a scenario in which the GRB event occurred in a dwarf satellite of the interacting group and interpret the broad absorption signatures in the afterglow spectra as a collective effect of the turbulent halo gas and the host star-forming ISM. We briefly discuss the implications for the absorption properties observed in the afterglow spectra.},

abstract = {We present a study of 15 long-duration $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) host galaxies at z > 2. The GRBs are selected with available early-time afterglow spectra in order to compare interstellar medium (ISM) absorption-line properties with stellar properties of the host galaxies. In addition to five previously studied hosts, we consider new detections for the host galaxies of GRB 050820 and GRB 060206, and place 2$\sigma$ upper limits to the luminosities of the remaining unidentified hosts. We examine the nature of the host galaxy population and find that (1) the UV luminosity distribution of GRB host galaxies is consistent with expectations from a UV luminosity weighted random galaxy population with a median luminosity of langL(UV)rang = 0.1 L *, (2) there exists a moderate correlation between UV luminosity and Si II $\lambda$ 1526 absorption width, which together with the observed large line widths of W(1526)>1.5 {\AA} for a large fraction of the objects suggests a galactic outflow driven velocity field in the host galaxies, (3) there is tentative evidence for a trend of declining ISM metallicity with decreasing galaxy luminosity in the star-forming galaxy population at z = 2-4, (4) the interstellar UV radiation field is found to be 35-350× higher in GRB hosts than the Galactic mean value, and (5) additional galaxies are found at lsim2'' from the GRB host in all fields with known presence of strong Mg II absorbers, but no additional faint galaxies are found at lsim2'' in fields without strong Mg II absorbers. Our study confirms that the GRB host galaxies (with known optical afterglows) are representative of unobscured star-forming galaxies at z > 2, and demonstrates that high spatial resolution images are necessary for an accurate identification of GRB host galaxies in the presence of strong intervening absorbers.},

abstract = {Gas metallicity is a key quantity used to determine the physical conditions of gaseous clouds in a wide range of astronomical environments, including interstellar and intergalactic space. In particular, considerable effort in circumgalactic medium (CGM) studies focuses on metallicity measurements, because gas metallicity serves as a critical discriminator for whether the observed heavy ions in the CGM originate in chemically-enriched outflows or in more chemically-pristine gas accreted from the intergalactic medium. However, because the gas is ionized, a necessary first step in determining CGM metallicity is to constrain the ionization state of the gas which, in addition to gas density, depends on the ultraviolet background radiation field (UVB). While it is generally acknowledged that both the intensity and spectral slope of the UVB are uncertain, the impact of an uncertain spectral slope has not been properly addressed in the literature. This Letter shows that adopting a different spectral slope can result in an order of magnitude difference in the inferred CGM metallicity. Specifically, a harder UVB spectrum leads to a higher estimated gas metallicity for a given set of observed ionic column densities . Therefore, such systematic uncertainties must be folded into the error budget for metallicity estimates of ionized gas. An initial study shows that empirical diagnostics are available for discriminating between hard and soft ionizing spectra. Applying these diagnostics helps reduce the systematic uncertainties in CGM metallicity estimates.},

Knowledge of the nature of this dust is crucial for correcting for extinction, providing clues to the nature of GRB progenitors, and probing the interstellar medium of high-redshift galaxies as well as the nature of cosmic dust when the universe was much younger and galaxies were much less evolved. The dust and extinction properties of GRB host galaxies are still poorly known. Unlike previous work, we derive in this Letter the extinction curves for 10 GRB host galaxies without a priori assumption of any specific extinction types (such as those of the Milky Way or Small/Large Magellanic Clouds). It is found that there appear to exist two different types of extinction curves: one is relatively flat and gray, and the other displays a steeper dependence on inverse wavelength, closely resembling that of the Milky Way but with the 2175 {\AA} feature removed.},

The redshift z=0.1086 implies a peak brightness of M_g=-21.1 mag, placing the object within the regime of superluminous supernovae. We observe a dramatic spectral evolution, from initially being blue and featureless, to later developing features similar to those of the broadlined Type Ic SN 1998bw, and finally showing $\sim$2000 km s^-1 wide H-alpha and H-beta emission. Relatively narrow Balmer emission (reminiscent of a SN IIn) is present at all times. We also detect coronal lines, indicative of a dense circumstellar medium. We constrain the progenitor wind velocity to $\sim$50-60 km s^-1 based on P-Cygni profiles, which is far slower than those present in Wolf-Rayet stars. This may suggest that the progenitor passed through a luminous blue variable phase, or that the wind is instead from a binary companion red supergiant star. At late times we see the $\sim$2000 km s^-1 wide H-alpha emission persisting at high luminosity ($\sim$3x10^40 erg s^-1) for at least 100 day, perhaps indicative of additional mass loss at high velocities that could have been ejected by a pulsational pair instability.},

abstract = {Host galaxy properties provide strong constraints on the stellar progenitors of superluminous supernovae. By comparing a sample of 19 low-redshift (z < 0.3) superluminous supernova hosts to galaxy populations in the local Universe, we show that sub-solar metallicities seem to be a requirement. All superluminous supernovae in hosts with high measured gas-phase metallicities are found to explode at large galactocentric radii, indicating that the metallicity at the explosion site is likely lower than the integrated host value. We found that superluminous supernovae hosts do not always have star-formation rates higher than typical star-forming galaxies of the same mass. However, we confirm that high absolute specific star-formation rates are a feature of superluminous supernova host galaxies, but interpret this as simply a consequence of the anti-correlation between gas-phase metallicity and specific star-formation rate and the requirement of on-going star formation to produce young, massive stars greater than $\sim$ 10-20 M_sol. Based on our sample, we propose an upper limit of $\sim$ 0.5 Z_sol for forming superluminous supernova progenitors (assuming an N2 metallicity diagnostic and a solar oxygen abundance of 8.69). Finally, we show that if magnetar powering is the source of the extreme luminosity then the required initial spins appear to be correlated with metallicity of the host galaxy. This correlation needs further work, but if it holds it is a powerful link between the supernova parameters and nature of the progenitor population.},

PTF12dam is one of the closest and best studied super-luminous explosions that has a broad and slowly fading lightcurve similar to SN 2007bi. Here we present new photometry and spectroscopy for PTF12dam from 200-500 days (rest-frame) after peak and a detailed analysis of the host galaxy (SDSS J142446.21+461348.6 at z = 0.107). Using deep templates and image subtraction we show that the full lightcurve can be fit with a magnetar model if escape of high-energy gamma rays is taken into account. The full bolometric lightcurve from -53 to +399 days (with respect to peak) cannot be fit satisfactorily with the pair-instability models. An alternative model of interaction with a dense CSM produces a good fit to the data although this requires a very large mass ($\sim$ 13 M_sun) of hydrogen free CSM. The host galaxy is a compact dwarf (physical size $\sim$ 1.9 kpc) and with M_g = -19.33 +/- 0.10, it is the brightest nearby SLSN Ic host discovered so far. The host is a low mass system (2.8 x 10^8 M_sun) with a star-formation rate (5.0 M_sun/year), which implies a very high specific star-formation rate (17.9 Gyr^-1). The remarkably strong nebular lines provide detections of the [O III] \lambda 4363 and [O II] \lambda\lambda 7320,7330 auroral lines and an accurate oxygen abundance of 12 + log(O/H) = 8.05 +/- 0.09. We show here that they are at the extreme end of the metallicity distribution of dwarf galaxies and propose that low metallicity is a requirement to produce these rare and peculiar supernovae.},

This is among the densest spectroscopic coverage, and best-constrained rising lightcurve, for a fast-declining hydrogen-poor SLSN. The bolometric lightcurve can be reproduced with a millisecond magnetar model with $\sim$ 4 M_sol ejecta mass, and the temperature and velocity evolution is also suggestive of a magnetar as the power source. Spectral modelling indicates that the SN ejected $\sim$ 6 M_sol of CO-rich material with a kinetic energy of $\sim$ 7 x 10^51 erg, and suggests a partially thermalised additional source of luminosity between -2 d and +22 d. This may be due to interaction with a shell of material originating from pre-explosion mass loss. We further present a detailed analysis of the host galaxy system of LSQ14mo. PESSTO and GROND imaging show three spatially resolved bright regions, and we used the VLT and FORS2 to obtain a deep (five-hour exposure) spectra of the SN position and the three star-forming regions, which are at a similar redshift. The FORS spectrum at +300 days shows no trace of SN emission lines and we place limits on the strength of [O I] from comparisons with other Ic SNe. The deep spectra provides a unique chance to investigate spatial variations in the host star-formation activity and metallicity. The specific star-formation rate is similar in all three components, as is the presence of a young stellar population. However, the position of LSQ14mo exhibits a lower metallicity, with 12 + log(O/H) = 8.2 in both the R23 and N2 scales (corresponding to $\sim$ 0.3 Z_sol). We propose that the three bright regions in the host system are interacting, which thus triggers star-formation and forms young stellar populations.},

abstract = {Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are found predominantly in dwarf galaxies, indicating that their progenitors have a low metallicity. However, the most nearby SLSN to date, SN 2017egm, occurred in the spiral galaxy NGC 3191, which has a relatively high stellar mass and correspondingly high metallicity. In this paper, we present detailed analysis of the nearby environment of SN 2017egm using MaNGA IFU data, which provides spectral data on kiloparsec scales. From the velocity map we find no evidence that SN 2017egm occurred within some intervening satellite galaxy, and at the SN position most metallicity diagnostics yield a solar and above solar metallicity (12 + log (O/H) = 8.8-9.1). Additionally we measure a small H-alpha equivalent width (EW) at the SN position of just 34 Angs, which is one of the lowest EWs measured at any SLSN or Gamma-Ray Burst position, and indicative of the progenitor star being comparatively old. We also compare the observed properties of NGC 3191 with other SLSN host galaxies. The solar-metallicity environment at the position of SN 2017egm presents a challenge to our theoretical understanding, and our spatially resolved spectral analysis provides further constraints on the progenitors of SLSNe.},

abstract = {The association of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with Type Ib/c supernovae implies that they explode into the winds of their Wolf-Rayet progenitor stars. Although the evolution of some GRB afterglows is consistent with expansion into a free wind, there is also good evidence for expansion into a constant density medium. The evidence includes the evolution of X-ray afterglows (when X-rays are below the cooling frequency), the evolution of the pre-jet break optical and X-ray afterglow, and the sharp turn-on observed for some afterglows. Recent observations of short bursts, which are expected to be interacting with a constant density medium, provide a check on the standard afterglow model. Although radio observations do not support the constant density model for long bursts in some cases, the evidence for constant density interaction is strong. The most plausible way to produce such a medium around a massive star is to shock the progenitor wind. This requires a smaller termination shock than would be expected, possibly due to a high pressure surroundings, a high progenitor velocity, or the particular evolution leading to a GRB. However, the need for the termination shock near the deceleration radius cannot be plausibly accomodated and may indicate that some long bursts have compact binary progenitors and explode directly into the interstellar medium.},

abstract = {We examine the case where a circumstellar medium around a supernova is sufficiently opaque that a radiation dominated shock propagates in the circumstellar region. The initial propagation of the shock front into the circumstellar region can be approximated by a self-similar solution that determines the radiative energy in a shocked shell; the eventual escape of this energy gives the maximum luminosity of the supernova. If the circumstellar density is described by \rho=Dr^{-2} out to a radius R_w, where D is a constant, the properties of the shock breakout radiation depend on R_w and R_d\equiv\kappa Dv_{sh}/c, where \kappa is the opacity and v_{sh} is the shock velocity. If R_w>R_d, the rise to maximum light begins at $\sim$ R_d/v_{sh}; the duration of the rise is also $\sim$ R_d/v_{sh}; the outer parts of the opaque medium are extended and at low velocity at the time of peak luminosity; and a dense shell forms whose continued interaction with the dense mass loss gives a characteristic flatter portion of the declining light curve. If R_w<R_d, the rise to maximum light begins at R_w/v_{sh}; the duration of the rise is R_w^2/v_{sh}R_d; the outer parts of the opaque medium are not extended and are accelerated to high velocity by radiation pressure at the time of maximum luminosity; and a dense shell forms but does not affect the light curve near maximum. We argue that SN 2006gy is an example of the first kind of event, while SN 2010gx and related supernovae are examples of the second.},

abstract = {We present results for the first three years of OzDES, a six-year programme to obtain redshifts for objects in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) supernova fields using the 2dF fibre positioner and AAOmega spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. OzDES is a multi-object spectroscopic survey targeting multiple types of targets at multiple epochs over a multi-year baseline, and is one of the first multi-object spectroscopic surveys to dynamically include transients into the target list soon after their discovery. At the end of three years, OzDES has spectroscopically confirmed almost 100 supernovae, and has measured redshifts for 17,000 objects, including the redshifts of 2,566 supernova hosts. We examine how our ability to measure redshifts for targets of various types depends on signal-to-noise, magnitude, and exposure time, finding that our redshift success rate increases significantly at a signal-to-noise of 2 to 3 per 1-Angstrom bin. We also find that the change in signal-to-noise with exposure time closely matches the Poisson limit for stacked exposures as long as 10 hours. We use these results to predict the redshift yield of the full OzDES survey, as well as the potential yields of future surveys on other facilities such as the 4m Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST), the Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS), and the Maunakea Spectroscopic Explorer (MSE). This work marks the first OzDES data release, comprising 14,693 redshifts. OzDES is on target to obtain over a yield of approximately 5,700 supernova host-galaxy redshifts.},

abstract = {We examine the relationship between Type Ia Supernova (SN Ia) Hubble residuals and the properties of their host galaxies using a sample of 115 SNe Ia from the Nearby Supernova Factory (SNfactory). We use host galaxy stellar masses and specific star-formation rates fitted from photometry for all hosts, as well as gas-phase metallicities for a subset of 69 star-forming (non-AGN) hosts, to show that the SN Ia Hubble residuals correlate with each of these host properties. With these data we find new evidence for a correlation between SN Ia intrinsic color and host metallicity. When we combine our data with those of other published SN Ia surveys, we find the difference between mean SN Ia brightnesses in low and high mass hosts is 0.077 +- 0.014 mag. When viewed in narrow (0.2 dex) bins of host stellar mass, the data reveal apparent plateaus of Hubble residuals at high and low host masses with a rapid transition over a short mass range (9.8 <= log(M_*/M_Sun) <= 10.4). Although metallicity has been a favored interpretation for the origin of the Hubble residual trend with host mass, we illustrate how dust in star-forming galaxies and mean SN Ia progenitor age both evolve along the galaxy mass sequence, thereby presenting equally viable explanations for some or all of the observed SN Ia host bias.},

abstract = {We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of galaxies hosting Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) observed by the Nearby Supernova Factory (SNfactory). Combining GALEX UV data with optical and near infrared photometry, we employ stellar population synthesis techniques to measure SN Ia host galaxy stellar masses, star-formation rates (SFRs), and reddening due to dust. We reinforce the key role of GALEX UV data in deriving accurate estimates of galaxy SFRs and dust extinction. Optical spectra of SN Ia host galaxies are fitted simultaneously for their stellar continua and emission lines fluxes, from which we derive high precision redshifts, gas-phase metallicities, and H$\alpha$-based SFRs. With these data we show that SN Ia host galaxies present tight agreement with the fiducial galaxy mass–metallicity relation from SDSS for stellar masses log(M * /M) > 8.5 where the relation is well-defined. The star-formation activity of SN Ia host galaxies is consistent with a sample of comparable SDSS field galaxies, though this comparison is limited by systematic uncertainties in SFR measurements. Our analysis indicates that SN Ia host galaxies are, on average, typical representatives of normal field galaxies.},

abstract = {Galactic outflows regulate the amount of gas galaxies convert into stars. However, it is difficult to measure the mass outflows remove because they span a large range of temperatures and phases. Here, we study the rest-frame ultraviolet spectrum of a lensed galaxy at z ∼ 2.9 with prominent interstellar absorption lines from O I, tracing neutral gas, up to O VI, tracing transitional phase gas. The O VI profile mimics weak low-ionization profiles at low velocities, and strong saturated profiles at high velocities. These trends indicate that O VI gas is co-spatial with the low-ionization gas. Further, at velocities blueward of -200 km s −1 the column density of the low-ionization outflow rapidly drops while the O VI column density rises, suggesting that O VI is created as the low-ionization gas is destroyed. Photoionization models do not reproduce the observed O VI, but adequately match the low-ionization gas, indicating that the phases have different formation mechanisms. Photoionized outflows are more massive than O VI outflows for most of the observed velocities, although the O VI mass outflow rate exceeds the photoionized outflow at velocities above the galaxy's escape velocity. Therefore, most gas capable of escaping the galaxy is in a hot outflow phase. We suggest that the O VI absorption is a temporary by-product of conduction transferring mass from the photoionized phase to an unobserved hot wind, and discuss how this mass-loading impacts the observed circum-galactic medium.},

abstract = {We study the ionization structure of galactic outflows in 37 nearby, star forming galaxies with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope. We use the O I, Si II, Si III, and Si IV ultraviolet absorption lines to characterize the different ionization states of outflowing gas. We measure the equivalent widths, line widths, and outflow velocities of the four transitions, and find shallow scaling relations between them and galactic stellar mass and star formation rate. Regardless of the ionization potential, lines of similar strength have similar velocities and line widths, indicating that the four transitions can be modeled as a co-moving phase. The Si equivalent width ratios (e.g. Si IV/Si II) have low dispersion, and little variation with stellar mass; while ratios with O I and Si vary by a factor of 2 for a given stellar mass. Photo-ionization models reproduce these equivalent width ratios, while shock models under predict the relative amount of high ionization gas. The photo-ionization models constrain the ionization parameter (U) between -2.25 < log(U) < -1.5, and require that the outflow metallicities are greater than 0.5 Z$_\odot$. We derive ionization fractions for the transitions, and show that the range of ionization parameters and stellar metallicities leads to a factor of 1.15-10 variation in the ionization fractions. Historically, mass outflow rates are calculated by converting a column density measurement from a single metal ion into a total Hydrogen column density using an ionization fraction, thus mass outflow rates are sensitive to the assumed ionization structure of the outflow.},

The spectrum exhibits a well-detected continuum at wavelengths longer than 8915 Angs with a steep decrement to zero flux blueward of 8910 Angs due to Ly-alpha absorption at redshift z$\sim$6.33. Some transmission through the Lyman-alpha forest is present at 5.2<z<5.733, but none is detected at higher redshift, consistent with previous measurements from quasars and GRB 130606A. We model the red damping wing of Lyman-alpha in three ways that provide equally good fits to the data: (a) a single host galaxy absorber at z=6.327 with log(N_HI)=18.62+/-0.08; (b) pure intergalactic medium (IGM) absorption from z=6.0 to z=6.328 with a constant neutral hydrogen fraction of x_HI=0.056+0.011-0.027; and (c) a hybrid model with a host absorber located within an ionized bubble of radius 10 comoving Mpc in an IGM with x_HI=0.12+/-0.05 (x_HI<0.21 at the 2-sigma level). Regardless of the model, the sharpness of the dropoff in transmission is inconsistent with a substantial neutral fraction in the IGM at this redshift. No narrow absorption lines from the host galaxy are detected, indicating a host metallicity of [Z/H]<$\sim$ -0.8. Even if we assume that all of the hydrogen absorption is due to the host galaxy, the column is unusually low for a GRB sightline, similar to two out of the other three highest-redshift bursts with measured log(N_HI). This is possible evidence that the escape fraction of ionizing photons from normal star-forming galaxies increases at z>$\sim$6.},

abstract = {We present a composite spectrum of 60 long duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows with redshifts in the range 0.35 < z < 6.7 observed with low-resolution optical spectra. The composite spectrum covers the wavelength range 700-6600 {\AA} in the rest frame and has a mean signal-to-noise ratio of 150 per 1 {\AA} pixel and reaches a maximum of $\sim$300 in the range 2500-3500 {\AA}. Equivalent widths are measured from metal absorption lines from the Ly$\alpha$ line to $\sim$5200 {\AA}, and associated metal and hydrogen lines are identified between the Lyman break and Ly$\alpha$ line. The average transmission within the Lyman forest is consistent with that found along quasar lines of sight. We find a temporal variation in fine-structure lines when dividing the sample into bursts observed within 2 hr from their trigger and those observed later. Other lines in the predominantly neutral gas show variations too, but this is most likely a random effect caused by weighting of individual strong absorption lines and which mimics a temporal variation. Bursts characterized with high- or low-prompt GRB energy release produce afterglows with similar absorption line strengths, and likewise for bursts with bright or faint optical afterglows. Bursts defined as dark from their optical to X-ray spectral index have stronger absorption lines relative to the optically bright bursts. The composite spectrum has strong Ca II and Mg II absorption lines as commonly found in dusty galaxies, however, we find no evidence for dust or a significant molecular content based on the non-detection of diffuse interstellar bands.

abstract = {We study a magnitude-limited sample of 10 gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxies with known spectroscopic redshifts (0.43 < z < 2.04). From an analysis of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs), based on published broad-band optical and near-infrared photometry, we derive photometric redshifts, galaxy types, ages of the dominant stellar populations, internal extinctions, and ultraviolet (UV) star-formation rates (SFRs) of the host galaxies. The photometric redshifts are quite accurate despite the heterogeneous nature of the sample: the rms errors are $\sigma$(z) = 0.21 and $\sigma$($\Delta$ z/(1+zspec)) = 0.16 with no significant systematic offsets. All the host galaxies have SEDs similar to young starburst galaxies with moderate to low extinction. A comparison of specific SFRs with those of high-redshift galaxies in the Hubble Deep Fields shows that GRB hosts are most likely similar to the field galaxies with the largest specific SFRs. On the other hand, GRB hosts are not significantly younger than starburst field galaxies at similar redshifts, but are found to be younger than a sample of all types of field galaxies.},

abstract = {Context: The collapsar model predicts that the progenitors of Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) are metal poor in Fe group elements. The existence of low metallicity stellar populations could manifest itself in the characteristics of the GRB site immediate environment in the host galaxy. <BR />Aims: We analyse the strong emission lines from the sub-luminous host galaxy of GRB 980425, which showed the first connection with a supernova explosion (SN 1998bw). The host is of sufficient size to allow detailed resolved spectroscopy of individual H II regions and to search for regions with peculiar properties close to the the GRB site. <BR />Methods: Using integral field spectroscopy with VIMOS we study most of the high surface brightness part of the host including the H II region where the supernova and GRB occurred. <BR />Results: The star formation rate, reddening, equivalent width and stellar mass in the GRB region is similar to other H II regions in the host. Extreme values arise in the only region that shows emission lines from Wolf-Rayet stars, a region that is located 800 pc in projection from the GRB site. Strong emission line diagnostics of all H II regions imply oxygen abundances between 0.3 and 0.8 solar with the lowest values arising in the WR and GRB regions. Including uncertainties from the metallicity diagnostics, all metallicities are similar to within 3$\sigma$. We demonstrate that there is a good agreement between the luminosity weighted and mass weighted specific star formation rates (SSFR) in individual young H II regions. While the global average of the SSFR is similar to high redshift GRB hosts, there are significant variations between individual resolved H II regions. Comparing the measured emission line ratios of low redshift GRB hosts to theoretical models and observations of field galaxies, we find that GRBs are present in different environment metallicities while the regions of their origin are consistently very young. Similar line ratios of GRB hosts compared with those of the WR region can arise in spatially unresolved galaxies with bright H II regions close to the GRB location.

abstract = {We combine Planck HFI data at 857, 545, 353 & 217GHz with data from WISE, Spitzer, IRAS & Herschel to investigate the properties of a flux limited sample of local star-forming galaxies. A 545GHz flux density limit was chosen so that the sample is 80% complete at this frequency, giving a sample of 234 local galaxies. We investigate the dust emission and star formation properties of the sample via various models & calculate the local dust mass function. Although 1-component modified black bodies fit the dust emission longward of 80um very well (median beta=1.83) the degeneracy between dust temp & beta also means that the SEDs are very well described by a dust emissivity index fixed at beta=2 and 10<T<25 K. Although a second, warmer dust component is required to fit shorter wavelength data, & contributes $\sim$1/3 of the total infrared emission, its mass is negligible. No evidence is found for a very cold (6-10 K) dust component. The temp of the cold dust component is strongly influenced by the ratio of the star formation rate to the total dust mass. This implies, contrary to what is often assumed, that a significant fraction of even the emission from $\sim$20 K dust is powered by ongoing star formation, whether or not the dust itself is associated with star forming clouds or `cirrus'. There is statistical evidence of a free-free contribution to the 217GHz flux densities of <20%. We find a median dust-to-stellar mass ratio of 0.0046; & that this ratio is anti-correlated with galaxy mass. There is good correlation between dust mass & atomic gas mass (median M_d/M_HI = 0.022), suggesting that galaxies that have more dust have more interstellar medium in general. Our derived dust mass function implies a mean dust mass density of the local Universe (for dust within galaxies), of 7.0+-1.4 x 10^5 M_solar/Mpc, significantly greater than that found in the most recent estimate using Herschel data.},

abstract = {Winds arising from galaxies, star clusters, and active galactic nuclei are crucial players in star and galaxy formation, but it has proven remarkably difficult to use observations of them to determine physical properties of interest, particularly mass fluxes. Much of the difficulty stems from a lack of a theory that links a physically-realistic model for winds' density, velocity, and covering factors to calculations of light emission and absorption. In this paper we provide such a model. We consider a wind launched from a turbulent region with a range of column densities, derive the differential acceleration of gas as a function of column density, and use this result to compute winds' absorption profiles, emission profiles, and emission intensity maps in both optically thin and optically thick species. The model is sufficiently simple that all required computations can be done analytically up to straightforward numerical integrals, rendering it suitable for the problem of deriving physical parameters by fitting models to observed data. We show that our model produces realistic absorption and emission profiles for some example cases, and argue that the most promising methods of deducing mass fluxes are based on combinations of absorption lines of different optical depths, or on combining absorption with measurements of molecular line emission. In the second paper in this series, we expand on these ideas by introducing a set of observational diagnostics that are significantly more robust that those commonly in use, and that can be used to obtain improved estimates of wind properties.},

PRIMUS covers a total of 9.1deg2 of sky to a depth of i AB 23.5 in seven different deep, multi-wavelength fields that have coverage from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer, Spitzer, and either XMM or Chandra, as well as multiple-band optical and near-IR coverage. PRIMUS includes 130,000 robust redshifts of unique objects with a redshift precision of $\sigma$z/(1 + z) 0.005. The redshift distribution peaks at z 0.6 and extends to z = 1.2 for galaxies and z = 5 for broad-line active galactic nuclei. The motivation, observational techniques, fields, target selection, slitmask design, and observations are presented here, with a brief summary of the redshift precision; a forthcoming paper presents the data reduction, redshift fitting, redshift confidence, and survey completeness. PRIMUS is the largest faint galaxy survey undertaken to date.

abstract = {We present detailed ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared light curves of the TypeIa supernova (SN) 2012fr, which exploded in the Fornax cluster member NGC1365. These precise high-cadence light curves provide a dense coverage of the flux evolution from −12 to +140 days with respect to the epoch of B-band maximum (t B max). Supplementary imaging at the earliest epochs reveals an initial slow and nearly linear rise in luminosity with a duration of ∼2.5 days, followed by a faster rising phase that is well reproduced by an explosion model with a moderate amount of 56 Ni mixing in the ejecta. From our analysis of the light curves, we conclude that: (i) the explosion occurred <22 hr before the first detection of the supernova, (ii) the rise time to peak bolometric ($\lambda$>1800 {\AA}) luminosity was 16.5±0.6 days, (iii) the supernova suffered little or no host-galaxy dust reddening, (iv) the peak luminosity in both the optical and near-infrared was consistent with the bright end of normal TypeIa diversity, and (v) 0.60±0.15 M e of 56 Ni was synthesized in the explosion. Despite its normal luminosity, SN2012fr displayed unusually prevalent high-velocity Ca II and Si II absorption features, and a nearly constant photospheric velocity of the Si II $\lambda$6355 line at ∼12,000 km s 1-that began ∼5 days before t B max. We also highlight some of the other peculiarities in the early phase photometry and the spectral evolution. SN2012fr also adds to a growing number of TypeIa supernovae that are hosted by galaxies with direct Cepheid distance measurements.},

CSS161010 shows luminous X-ray ($L_x\sim5\times 10^{39}\,\rm{erg\,s^{-1}}$) and radio ($L_{\nu}\sim10^{29}\,\rm{erg\,s^{-1}Hz^{-1}}$) emission. The radio emission peaked at $\sim$100 days post transient explosion and rapidly decayed. We interpret these observations in the context of synchrotron emission from an expanding blastwave. CSS161010 launched a mildly relativistic outflow with velocity $\Gamma\beta c\ge0.55c$ at $\sim$100 days. This is faster than the non-relativistic AT2018cow ($\Gamma\beta c\sim0.1c$) and closer to ZTF18abvkwla ($\Gamma\beta c\ge0.3c$ at 63 days). The inferred initial kinetic energy of CSS161010 ($E_k\gtrsim10^{51}$ erg) is comparable to that of long Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), but the ejecta mass that is coupled to the mildly relativistic outflow is significantly larger ($\sim0.01-0.1\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$). This is consistent with the lack of observed gamma-rays. The luminous X-rays were produced by a different emission component to the synchrotron radio emission. CSS161010 is located at $\sim$150 Mpc in a dwarf galaxy with stellar mass $M_{*}\sim10^{7}\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ and specific star formation rate $sSFR\sim 0.3\,\rm{Gyr^{-1}}$. This mass is among the lowest inferred for host-galaxies of explosive transients from massive stars. Our observations of CSS161010 are consistent with an engine-driven aspherical explosion from a rare evolutionary path of a H-rich stellar progenitor, but we cannot rule out a stellar tidal disruption event on a centrally-located intermediate mass black hole. Regardless of the physical mechanism, CSS161010 establishes the existence of a new class of rare (rate $<0.4\%$ of the local core-collapse supernova rate) H-rich transients that can launch mildly relativistic outflows.},

abstract = {Establishing the nature of $\gamma$-ray bursts is one of the greatest challenges in high-energy astrophysics. The distribution of these bursts is isotropic across the sky, but inhomogeneous in space, with a deficit of faint bursts. It is currently unknown whether $\gamma$-ray bursts are produced in our Galaxy or at cosmological distances. The detection and identification of counterparts at other wavelengths are seen as crucial for resolving the origin of the events. Here we report the detection by the Beppo-SAX satellite of an X-ray 'afterglow', associated with the $\gamma$-ray burst of 28 February 1997 (GRB970228; ref. 3) - the first such detection for any $\gamma$-ray burst. The X- ray transient was found to contain a significant fraction of the total energy of the $\gamma$-ray burst and, following the initial detection eight hours after the main burst, faded within a few days with a power-law decay function. The rapid locating of this $\gamma$-ray burst instigated a multi-wavelength observational campaign that culminated in the identification of a fading optical transient in a position consistent with the X-ray transient reported here.},

abstract = {In this paper, we compute rest-frame extinctions for the afterglows of a sample of Swift gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) complete in redshift. The selection criteria of the sample are based on observational high-energy parameters of the prompt emission and therefore our sample should not be biased against dusty sight-lines. It is therefore expected that our inferences hold for the general population of GRBs. Our main result is that the optical/near-infrared extinction of GRB afterglows in our sample does not follow a single distribution. 87 per cent of the events are absorbed by less than 2 mag, and 50 per cent suffer from less than 0.3-0.4 mag extinction. The remaining 13 per cent of the afterglows are highly absorbed. The true percentage of GRB afterglows showing high absorption could be even higher since a fair fraction of the events without reliable redshift measurement are probably part of this class. These events may be due to highly dusty molecular clouds/star-forming regions associated with the GRB progenitor or along the afterglow line of sight, and/or due to massive dusty host galaxies. No clear evolution in the dust extinction properties is evident within the redshift range of our sample, although the largest extinctions are at z \tilde 1.5-2, close to the expected peak of the star formation rate. Those events classified as dark are characterized, on average, by a higher extinction than typical events in the sample. A correlation between optical/near-infrared extinction and hydrogen-equivalent column density based on X-ray studies is shown, although the observed N$_H$ appears to be well in excess compared to those observed in the Local Group. Dust extinction does not seem to correlate with GRB energetics or luminosity.},

abstract = {In our current galaxy formation paradigm, high-redshift galaxies are predominantly fuelled by accretion of cool, metal-poor gas from the intergalactic medium. Hydrodynamical simulations predict that this material should be observable in absorption against background sightlines within a galaxy's virial radius, as optically thick Lyman-limit systems (LLSs) with low metallicities. Here we report the discovery of exactly such a strong metal-poor absorber at an impact parameter R_perp = 58 kpc from a star-forming galaxy at z = 2.44. Besides strong neutral hydrogen [N(HI) = 10^(19.50 +/- 0.16) cm^-2] we detect neutral deuterium and oxygen, allowing a precise measurement of the metallicity: log10(Z / Zsolar) = -2.0 +/- 0.17, or (7-15) x 10^-3 solar. Furthermore, the narrow deuterium linewidth requires a cool temperature < 20,000 K. Given the striking similarities between this system and the predictions of simulations, we argue that it represents the direct detection of a high redshift cold-accretion stream. The low-metallicity gas cloud is a single component of an absorption system exhibiting a complex velocity, ionization, and enrichment structure. Two other components have metallicities > 0.1 solar, ten times larger than the metal-poor component. We conclude that the photoionized circumgalactic medium (CGM) of this galaxy is highly inhomogeneous: the majority of the gas is in a cool, metal-poor and predominantly neutral phase, but the majority of the metals are in a highly-ionized phase exhibiting weak neutral hydrogen absorption but strong metal absorption. If such inhomogeneity is common, then high-resolution spectra and detailed ionization modelling are critical to accurately appraise the distribution of metals in the high-redshift CGM.},

abstract = {The startling discovery of Prochter et al. (2006) that the frequency of very strong (W_r(2796)>1 A) MgII absorbers along gamma-ray burst (GRB) lines of sight ([dN/dz]_{GRB} = 0.90) is more than three times the frequency along quasar lines of sight ([dN/dz]_{QSO} = 0.24), over similar redshift ranges, has yet to be understood. We reconsider the possibility that the excess of very strong MgII absorbers toward GRBs is intrinsic either to the GRBs themselves or to their immediate environment, and associated with bulk outflows with velocities as large as v_{max} $\sim$ 0.3c. In order to examine this hypothesis, we accumulate a sample of 27 W_r(2796) > 1 A absorption systems found toward 81 quasars, and compare their properties to those of 9 W_r(2796)>1 A absorption systems found toward 6 GRBs; all systems have been observed at high spectral resolution (R = 45,000) using the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph on the Very Large Telescope. We make multiple comparisons of the absorber properties across the two populations, testing for differences in metallicity, ionization state, abundance patterns, dust abundance, kinematics, and phase structure. We find no significant differences between the two absorber populations using any of these metrics, implying that, if the excess absorbers toward GRB lines of sight are indeed intrinsic, they must be produced in a process which has strong similarities to the processes yielding strong MgII systems in association with intervening galaxies. Although this may seem a priori unlikely, given the high outflow velocities required for any intrinsic model, we note that the same conclusion was reached, recently, with respect to the narrow absorption line systems seen in some quasars.},

Their cosmological nature makes them the best tool to explore the final stages in the lives of very massive stars up to the highest redshifts. Furthermore, studying the emission from their low-energy counterparts (optical and infrared) via rapid spectroscopy, we have been able to pin down the exact location of the most distant galaxies as well as placing stringent constraints on their host galaxies and intervening systems at low and high-redshift (e.g. metallicity and neutral hydrogen fraction). In fact, each GRB spectrum contains absorption features imprinted by metals in the host interstellar medium (ISM) as well as the intervening intergalactic medium (IGM) along the line of sight. In this chapter we summarize the progress made using a large dataset of GRB spectra in understanding the nature of both these absorbers and how GRBs can be used to study the early Universe, in particular to measure the neutral hydrogen fraction and the escape fraction of UV photons before and during the epoch of re-ionization.},

abstract = {We study the gamma-ray burst GRB 081008 environment by analysing the spectra of its optical afterglow. UVES high resolution spectroscopy of GRB 081008 was secured \$\sim$5 hr after the Swift trigger. Our dataset comprises also three FORS2 nearly simultaneous spectra of the same source. The availability of nearly simultaneous high and low resolution spectra for a GRB afterglow is an extremely rare event. The GRB-Damped Lyman Alpha system at z = 1.9683 shows that the interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxy is constituted by at least three components which contribute to the line profiles. Component I is the redmost one, and is 20 km/s and 78 km/s redward component II and III, respectively. We detect several ground state and excited absorption features in components I and II. These features have been used to compute the distances between the GRB and the absorbers. Component I is found to be 52 +/- 6 pc away from the GRB, while component II presents few excited transitions and its distance is 200+60-80\ pc. The hydrogen column density associated to GRB 081008 is log NH/cm\^-2 = 21.11 +/- 0.10, and the metallicity of the host galaxy is in the range [X/H] = -1.29 to -0.52. In particular, we found [Fe/H]=-1.19 +/- 0.11 and [Zn/H]=-0.52 +/- 0.11 with respect to solar values. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of dust in the GRB ISM, given the opposite refractory properties of iron and zinc. By deriving the depletion pattern for GRB 081008, we find the optical extinction in the visual band to be AV \$\sim$ 0.19 mag. The Curve of Growth analysis applied to the FORS2 spectra brings column densities consistent at the 3 sigma level to that evaluated from the UVES data using the line fitting procedure. This reflects the low saturation of the detected GRB$\backslash$,081008 absorption features.},

abstract = {Aims. The aim of this paper is to study the environment and intervening absorbers of the gamma-ray burst GRB 090926A through analyzing optical spectra of its afterglow. Methods. We analyzed medium-resolution spectroscopic observations (R = 10 000, corresponding to 30 km s-1, S/N = 15-30 and wavelength range 3000-25 000) of the optical afterglow of GRB 090926A, taken with X-shooter at the VLT ∼22 h after the GRB trigger. Results. The spectrum shows that the ISM in the GRB host galaxy at z = 2.1071 is rich in absorption features, with two components contributing to the line profiles. In addition to the ground state lines, we detect C ii, O i, Si ii, Fe ii, and Ni ii-excited absorption features, which we used to derive information on the distance between the host absorbing gas and the site of the GRB explosion. The distance of component I is found to be 2.40 ± 0.15 kpc, while component II is located far away from the GRB, possibly at ∼5 kpc. These values are compatible with those found for other GRBs. The hydrogen column density associated to GRB 090926A is log NH/cm -2 = 21.60 ± 0.07, and the metallicity of the host galaxy is in the range [X/H] = -2.5 to -1.9 with respect to the solar values, i.e., among the lowest values ever observed for a GRB host galaxy. A comparison with galactic chemical evolution models has suggested that the host of GRB090926A is likely to be a dwarf-irregular galaxy. No emission lines were detected, but a H$\alpha$ flux in emission of 9 × 10 -18 erg s-1 cm-2 (i.e., a star-formation rate of 2 $M-\odot$ yr-1), which is typical of many GRB hosts, would have been detected in our spectra, and thus emission lines are well within the reach of X-shooter. We put an upper limit to the H molecular fraction of the host galaxy ISM, which is f < 7 × 10-7. The continuum has been fitted assuming a power-law spectrum, with a spectral index of $\beta$ = 0.89-0.02+0.02. The best fit does essentially not require any intrinsic extinction because EB-V < 0.01 mag adopting a SMC extinction curve. Finally, the line of sight of GRB 090926A presents four weak intervening absorption systems in the redshift range 1.24 < z < 1.95. {\textcopyright} 2010 ESO.},

At log N HI   <  14.0, the detection rates drop to  < 10 per cent, possibly due to our sensitivity limits and not to an actual variation of the gas abundance properties. In the range log Nhi ≥ 14, we observe a fraction of H i lines with detected C iv a factor of 2 larger than the fraction of H i lines lying in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of relatively bright Lyman-break galaxies hosted by dark matter haloes with  < M > $\sim$ 10 12  M o˙ . The comparison of our results with the output of a grid of photoionization models and of two cosmological simulations implies that the volume filling factor of the IGM gas enriched to a metallicity log Z/Z o˙  ≳ - 3 should be of the order of $\sim$10-13 per cent. In conclusion, our results favour a scenario in which metals are found also outside the CGM of bright star-forming galaxies, possibly due to pollution by lower mass objects and/or to an early enrichment by the first sources.},

abstract = {Aims: We present a study of the environment of the Swift long gamma-ray burst GRB 120327A at z ≈ 2.8 through optical spectroscopy of its afterglow. Methods: We analyzed medium-resolution, multi-epoch spectroscopic observations (R $\sim$ 7000-12 000, corresponding to $\sim$15-23 km s-1, S/N = 15-30 and wavelength range 3000-25 000 {\AA}) of the optical afterglow of GRB 120327A, taken with X-shooter at the VLT 2.13 and 27.65 hr after the GRB trigger. Results: The first epoch spectrum shows that the ISM in the GRB host galaxy at z = 2.8145 is extremely rich in absorption features, with three components contributing to the line profiles. The hydrogen column density associated with GRB 120327A has log NH/cm-2 = 22.01 ± 0.09, and the metallicity of the host galaxy is in the range [X/H] = -1.3 to -1.1. In addition to the ground state lines, we detect absorption features associated with excited states of C ii, O i, Si ii, Fe ii, and Ni ii, which we used to derive information on the distance between the host absorbing gas and the site of the GRB explosion. The variability of the Fe ii$\lambda$2396 excited line between the two epochs proves that these features are excited by the GRB UV flux. Moreover, the distance of component I is found to be dI = 200+100-60 pc, while component II is located closer to the GRB, at dII = 100+40-30 pc. These values are among the lowest found in GRBs. Component III does not show excited transitions, so it should be located farther away from the GRB. The presence of H2 molecules is firmly established, with a molecular fraction f in the range f = 4 × 10-7-10-4. This particularly low value can be attributed to the small dust content. This represents the third positive detection of molecules in a GRB environment.

abstract = {Feedback from star formation is thought to play a key role in the formation and evolution of galaxies, but its implementation in cosmological simulations is currently hampered by a lack of numerical resolution. We present and test a sub-grid recipe to model feedback from massive stars in cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. The energy is distributed in kinetic form among the gas particles surrounding recently formed stars. The impact of the feedback is studied using a suite of high-resolution simulations of isolated disc galaxies embedded in dark halos with total mass 10^{10} and 10^{12} Msol/h. We focus in particular on the effect of pressure forces on wind particles within the disc, which we turn off temporarily in some of our runs to mimic a recipe that has been widely used in the literature. We find that this popular recipe gives dramatically different results because (ram) pressure forces on expanding superbubbles determine both the structure of the disc and the development of large-scale outflows. Pressure forces exerted by expanding superbubbles puff up the disc, giving the dwarf galaxy an irregular morphology and creating a galactic fountain in the massive galaxy. Hydrodynamic drag within the disc results in a strong increase of the effective mass loading of the wind for the dwarf galaxy, but quenches much of the outflow in the case of the high-mass galaxy.},

abstract = {<p>Redshifts have been so easy to measure for so long that we tend to neglect the fact that they too have uncertainties and are susceptible to systematic error. As we strive to measure cosmological parameters to better than 1% it is worth reviewing the accuracy of our redshift measurements. Surprisingly small systematic redshift errors, as low as 10−4, can have a significant impact on the cosmological parameters we infer, such as H0. Here we investigate an extensive (but not exhaustive) list of ways in which redshift estimation can go systematically astray. We review common theoretical errors, such as adding redshifts instead of multiplying by (1 + z); using v = cz; and using only cosmological redshift in the estimates of luminosity and angular-diameter distances. We consider potential observational errors, such as rest wavelength precision, air to vacuum conversion, and spectrograph wavelength calibration. Finally, we explore physical effects, such as peculiar velocity corrections, galaxy internal velocities, gravitational redshifts, and overcorrecting within a bulk flow. We conclude that it would be quite easy for small systematic redshift errors to have infiltrated our data and be impacting our cosmological results. While it is unlikely that these errors are large enough to resolve the current H0 tension, it remains possible, and redshift accuracy may become a limiting factor in near future experiments. With the enormous efforts going into calibrating the vertical axis of our plots (standard candles, rulers, clocks, and sirens) we argue that it is now worth paying a little more attention to the horizontal axis (redshifts).</p>},

abstract = {Motivated by the anomalous dust-to-metal ratios (DTM) derived in the literature for gamma-ray burst (GRB) damped Ly-alpha absorbers (DLAs), we measure these ratios using the dust-depletion pattern observed in UV/optical afterglow spectra, associated with the interstellar medium (ISM) at the GRB host-galaxy redshifts. Our sample consists of 20 GRB absorbers and a comparison sample of 72 QSO-DLAs, overall at redshift 1.2 < z < 4.0 and down to Z = 0.002 Zsol metallicities. The DTM in QSO- and GRB-DLAs increases both with metallicity and metal column density, spanning $\sim$10--110% the Galactic value and pointing to a non-universal dust-to-metal ratio. The low values of DTM indicate that low metallicity systems have lower dust fractions than typical spiral galaxies and perhaps that the dust in these systems is produced inefficiently, i.e. by formation in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) winds and by grain growth in the low-metallicity regime, with little contribution from supernovae (SNe). On the other hand, some GRB- and QSO-DLAs show high DTM values out to z $\sim$ 4, requiring rapid dust-production, such as in SN ejecta, but also in AGB winds and via grain growth for the highest metallicity systems. GRB-DLAs overall follow the DTM properties of QSO-DLAs, GRBs probing up to higher column and volume densities. For comparison, the DTM that we derive for the SMC and LMC are $\sim$82--100% and $\sim$98% of the Galactic value, respectively. The literature DTM value of the low-metallicity galaxy I Zw 18 (< 37%) is consistent with the DTM distribution that we find. The dust extinction AV increases steeply with the column density of iron in dust, N(Fe)dust, calculated from relative metal abundances, confirming that dust extinction is mostly occurring in the host galaxy ISM. Most GRB-DLAs display log N(Fe)dust > 14.7, above which several QSO-DLAs reveal H2, making GRB-DLAs promising candidates for molecular research.},

abstract = {We investigate the light-curve properties of a sample of 26 spectroscopically confirmed hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) in the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) survey. These events are brighter than SNe Ib/c and SNe Ic-BL, on average, by about 4 and 2$\sim$mag, respectively. The peak absolute magnitudes of SLSNe-I in rest-frame $g$ band span $-22\lesssim M_g \lesssim-20$$\sim$mag, and these peaks are not powered by radioactive $^{56}$Ni, unless strong asymmetries are at play. The rise timescales are longer for SLSNe than for normal SNe Ib/c, by roughly 10 days, for events with similar decay times. Thus, SLSNe-I can be considered as a separate population based on photometric properties. After peak, SLSNe-I decay with a wide range of slopes, with no obvious gap between rapidly declining and slowly declining events. The latter events show more irregularities (bumps) in the light curves at all times. At late times, the SLSN-I light curves slow down and cluster around the $^{56}$Co radioactive decay rate. Powering the late-time light curves with radioactive decay would require between 1 and 10${\rm M}_\odot$ of Ni masses. Alternatively, a simple magnetar model can reasonably fit the majority of SLSNe-I light curves, with four exceptions, and can mimic the radioactive decay of $^{56}$Co, up to $\sim400$ days from explosion. The resulting spin values do not correlate with the host-galaxy metallicities. Finally, the analysis of our sample cannot strengthen the case for using SLSNe-I for cosmology.},

abstract = {We study metal depletion due to dust in the interstellar medium (ISM) to infer the properties of dust grains and characterize the metal and dust content of galaxies, down to low metallicity and intermediate redshift z. We provide metal column densities and abundances of a sample of 70 damped Lyman-{\alpha} absorbers (DLAs) towards quasars, observed at high spectral resolution with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES). This is the largest sample of phosphorus abundances measured in DLAs so far. We use literature measurements for Galactic clouds to cover the high-metallicity end. We discover tight (scatter <= 0.2 dex) correlations between [Zn/Fe] and the observed relative abundances from dust depletion. This implies that grain growth in the ISM is an important process of dust production. These sequences are continuous in [Zn/Fe] from dust-free to dusty DLAs, and to Galactic clouds, suggesting that the availability of refractory metals in the ISM is crucial for dust production, regardless of the star formation history. We observe [S/Zn] up to $\sim$ 0.25 dex in DLAs, which is broadly consistent with Galactic stellar abundances. Furthermore, we find a good agreement between the nucleosynthetic pattern of Galactic halo stars and our observations of the least dusty DLAs. This supports recent star formation in low-metallicity DLAs. The derived depletions of Zn, O, P, S, Si, Mg, Mn, Cr, and Fe correlate with [Zn/Fe], with steeper slopes for more refractory elements. P is mostly not affected by dust depletion. We present canonical depletion patterns, to be used as reference in future studies of relative abundances and depletion. We derive the total (dust-corrected) metallicity, typically -2 <= [M/H]tot <= 0 for DLAs, and scattered around solar metallicity for the Galactic ISM.

abstract = {Interpreting abundances of Damped Ly-$\alpha$ Absorbers (DLAs) from absorption-line spectroscopy has typically been a challenge because of the presence of dust. Nevertheless, because DLAs trace distant gas-rich galaxies regardless of their luminosity, they provide an attractive way of measuring the evolution of the metallicity of the neutral gas with cosmic time. This has been done extensively so far, but typically not taking proper dust corrections into account. The aims of this paper are to: i) provide a simplified way of calculating dust corrections, based on a single observed [$X$/Fe], ii) assess the importance of dust corrections for DLA metallicities and their evolution, and iii) investigate the cosmic evolution of iron for a large DLA sample. We have derived dust corrections based on the observed [Zn/Fe], [Si/Fe], or [S/Fe], and confirmed their robustness. We present dust-corrected metallicities in a scale of [Fe/H]$_{\rm tot}$ for 236 DLAs over a broad range of $z$, and assess the extent of dust corrections for different metals at different metallicities. Dust corrections in DLAs are important even for Zn (typically of 0.1-0.2, and up to $0.5$$\sim$dex), which is often neglected. Finally, we study the evolution of the dust-corrected metallicity with $z$. The DLA metallicities decrease with redshift, by a factor of 50-100 from today to $\sim12.6$ billion years ago ($z=5$). When including dust corrections, the average DLA metallicities are 0.4--0.5$\sim$dex higher than without corrections. The upper envelope of the relation between metallicity and $z$ reaches solar metallicity at $z\lesssim0.5$, although some systems can have solar metallicity already out to $z\sim3$.},

abstract = {Context. The extreme brightness of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows and their simple spectral shape make them ideal beacons to study the interstellar medium of their host galaxies through absorption line spectroscopy at almost any redshift. Aims: We describe the distribution of rest-frame equivalent widths (EWs) of the most prominent absorption features in GRB afterglow spectra, providing the means to compare individual spectra to the sample and identify its peculiarities. Methods: Using 69 low-resolution GRB afterglow spectra, we conduct a study of the rest-frame EWs distribution of features with an average rest-frame EW larger than 0.5 {\AA}. To compare an individual GRB with the sample, we develop EW diagrams as a graphical tool, and we give a catalogue with diagrams for the 69 spectra. We introduce a line strength parameter (LSP) that allows us to quantify the strength of the absorption features in a GRB spectrum as compared to the sample by a single number. Using the distributions of EWs of single-species features, we derive the distribution of their column densities by a curve of growth (CoG) fit. Results: We find correlations between the LSP and the extinction of the GRB, the UV brightness of the host galaxies and the neutral hydrogen column density. However, we see no significant evolution of the LSP with the redshift. There is a weak correlation between the ionisation of the absorbers and the energy of the GRB, indicating that, either the GRB event is responsible for part of the ionisation, or that galaxies with high-ionisation media produce more energetic GRBs. Spectral features in GRB spectra are, on average, 2.5 times stronger than those seen in QSO intervening damped Lyman-$\alpha$ (DLA) systems and slightly more ionised. In particular we find a larger excess in the EW of C iv$\lambda$$\lambda$1549 relative to QSO DLAs, which could be related to an excess of Wolf-Rayet stars in the environments of GRBs. From the CoG fitting we obtain an average number of components in the absorption features of GRBs of 6.00-1.25+1.00. The most extreme ionisation ratios in our sample are found for GRBs with low neutral hydrogen column density, which could be related to ionisation by the GRB emission.

OCTOCAM has been proposed to the Gemini Observatory as a workhorse imager and spectrograph that will fulfill the needs of a large number of research areas in the 2020s. It is based on the use of high-efficiency dichroics to divide the incoming light in eight different channels, four optical and four infrared, each optimized for its wavelength range. In its imaging mode, it will observe a field of 3'x3' simultaneously in g, r, i, z, Y, J, H, and KS bands. It will obtain long-slit spectroscopy covering the range from 3700 to 23500 {\AA} with a resolution of 4000 and a slit length of 3 arcminutes. To avoid slit losses, the instrument it will be equipped with an atmospheric dispersion corrector for the complete spectral range. Thanks to the use of state of the art detectors, OCTOCAM will allow high time-resolution observations and will have negligible overheads in classical observing modes. It will be equipped with a unique integral field unit that will observe in the complete spectral range with an on-sky coverage of 9.7"x6.8", composed of 17 slitlets, 0.4" wide each. Finally, a state-of-the-art polarimetric unit will allow us to obtain simultaneous full Stokes spectropolarimetry of the range between 3700 and 22000 {\AA}.},

abstract = {The massive galaxies in the young universe, ten billion years ago, formed stars at surprising intensities. Although this is commonly attributed to violent mergers, the properties of many of these galaxies are incompatible with such events, showing gas-rich, clumpy, extended rotating disks not dominated by spheroids (Genzel et al. 2006, 2008). Cosmological simulations and clustering theory are used to explore how these galaxies acquired their gas. Here we report that they are stream-fed galaxies, formed from steady, narrow, cold gas streams that penetrate the shock-heated media of massive dark matter haloes (Dekel & Birnboim 2006; Keres et al. 2005). A comparison with the observed abundance of star-forming galaxies implies that most of the input gas must rapidly convert to stars. One-third of the stream mass is in gas clumps leading to mergers of mass ratio greater than 1:10, and the rest is in smoother flows. With a merger duy cycle of 0.1, three-quarters of the galaxies forming stars at a given rate are fed by smooth streams. The rarer, submillimetre galaxies that form stars even more intensely are largely merger-induced starbursts. Unlike destructive mergers, the streams are likely to keep the rotating disk configuration intact, although turbulent and broken into giant star-forming clumps that merge into a central spheroid (Noguchi 1999; Genzel et al. 2008, Elmegreen, Bournaud & Elmegreen 2008, Dekel, Sari & Ceverino 2009). This stream-driven scenario for the formation of disks and spheroids is an alternative to the merger picture.},

abstract = {The combination of multiple observational probes has long been advocated as a powerful technique to constrain cosmological parameters, in particular dark energy. The Dark Energy Survey has measured 207 spectroscopically--confirmed Type Ia supernova lightcurves; the baryon acoustic oscillation feature; weak gravitational lensing; and galaxy clustering. Here we present combined results from these probes, deriving constraints on the equation of state, $w$, of dark energy and its energy density in the Universe. Independently of other experiments, such as those that measure the cosmic microwave background, the probes from this single photometric survey rule out a Universe with no dark energy, finding $w=-0.80^{+0.09}_{-0.11}$. The geometry is shown to be consistent with a spatially flat Universe, and we obtain a constraint on the baryon density of $\Omega_b=0.069^{+0.009}_{-0.012}$ that is independent of early Universe measurements. These results demonstrate the potential power of large multi-probe photometric surveys and pave the way for order of magnitude advances in our constraints on properties of dark energy and cosmology over the next decade.},

abstract = {Much uncertainty surrounds the origin of superluminous supernovae (SNe).\nMotivated by the discovery of the Type Ic SN 2007bi, we study its\nproposed association with a pair-instability SN (PISN). We compute\nstellar evolution models for primordial {\tilde}200 M_{⊙}\nstars, simulating the implosion/explosion due to the pair-production\ninstability, and use them as inputs for detailed non-local thermodynamic\nequilibrium time-dependent radiative transfer simulations that include\nnon-local energy deposition and non-thermal processes. We retrieve the\nbasic morphology of PISN light curves from red supergiant, blue\nsupergiant and Wolf-Rayet (WR) star progenitors. Although we confirm\nthat a progenitor 100 M_{⊙} helium core (PISN model He100)\nfits well the SN 2007bi light curve, the low ratios of its kinetic\nenergy and ^{56}Ni mass to the ejecta mass, similar to standard\ncore-collapse SNe, conspire to produce cool photospheres, red spectra\nsubject to strong line blanketing and narrow-line profiles, all\nconflicting with SN 2007bi observations. He-core models of increasing\n^{56}Ni-to-ejecta mass ratio have bluer spectra, but still too\nred to match SN 2007bi, even for model He125 - the effect of\n^{56}Ni heating is offset by the associated increase in\nblanketing. In contrast, the delayed injection of energy by a magnetar\nrepresents a more attractive alternative to reproduce the blue, weakly\nblanketed and broad-lined spectra of superluminous SNe. The extra heat\nsource is free of blanketing and is not explicitly tied to the ejecta.\nExperimenting with an {\tilde}9 M_{⊙} WR-star progenitor,\ninitially exploded to yield an {\tilde}1.6 B SN Ib/c ejecta but later\ninfluenced by tunable magnetar-like radiation, we produce a diversity of\nblue spectral morphologies reminiscent of SN 2007bi, the peculiar Type\nIb SN 2005bf and superluminous SN 2005ap-like events.\n},

abstract = {We present new elemental abundance studies of seven damped Lyman-alpha systems (DLAs). Together with the four DLAs analyzed in Dessauges-Zavadsky et al. (2004), we have a sample of eleven DLA galaxies with uniquely comprehensive and homogeneous abundance measurements. These observations allow one to study the abundance patterns of 22 elements and the chemical variations in the interstellar medium of galaxies outside the Local Group. Comparing the gas-phase abundance ratios of these high redshift galaxies, we found that they show low RMS dispersions, reaching only up 2-3 times the statistical errors for the majority of elements. This uniformity is remarkable given that the quasar sightlines cross gaseous regions with HI column densities spanning over one order of magnitude and metallicities ranging from 1/55 to 1/5 solar. The gas-phase abundance patterns of interstellar medium clouds within the DLA galaxies detected along the velocity profiles show, on the other hand, a high dispersion in several abundance ratios, indicating that chemical variations seem to be more confined to individual clouds within the DLA galaxies than to integrated profiles. The analysis of the cloud-to-cloud chemical variations within seven individual DLAs reveals that five of them show statistically significant variations, higher than 0.2 dex at more than 3 sigma. The sources of these variations are both the differential dust depletion and/or ionization effects; however, no evidence for variations due to different star formation histories could be highlighted. These observations place large constraints on the mixing timescales of protogalaxies and on scenarios of galaxy formation within the CDM hierarchical theory. Finally, we provide an astrophysical determination of the oscillator strength of the NiII 1317 transition.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 SPIE. The Dark Energy Survey (DES) is an operating optical survey aimed at understanding the accelerating expansion of the universe using four complementary methods: weak gravitational lensing, galaxy cluster counts, baryon acoustic oscillations, and Type Ia supernovae. To perform the 5000 sq-degree wide field and 30 sq-degree supernova surveys, the DES Collaboration built the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), a 3 square-degree, 570-Megapixel CCD camera that was installed at the prime focus of the Blanco 4-meter telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO). DES has completed its third observing season out of a nominal five. This paper describes DES "Year 1" (Y1) to "Year 3" (Y3), the strategy, an outline of the survey operations procedures, the efficiency of operations and the causes of lost observing time. It provides details about the quality of the first three season's data, and describes how we are adjusting the survey strategy in the face of the El Nin{\~{o}} Southern Oscillation.},

abstract = {We use very deep spectra obtained with the Ultraviolet-Visual Echelle Spectrograph in the Very Large Telescope in order to determine the physical conditions, the chemical abundances and the iron depletion factors of four H II regions of the Large Magellanic Cloud and four H II regions of the Small Magellanic Cloud. The spectral range covered is 3100-10400 $\mathring{A}$ with a resolution of $\Delta\lambda \sim \lambda / 8800$. We measure the intensity of up to 200 emission lines in each object. Electron temperature and electron density are determined using different line intensity ratios. The ionic and total abundances are derived using collisionally excited lines for O, N, S, Cl, Ne, Ar, and Fe. The uncertainties are calculated using Monte Carlo simulations. This is the largest available set of high quality spectra for H II regions in the Magellanic Clouds. Thus, we can derive chemical abundances and depletion factors and constrain their variations across each galaxy with better accuracy than previous studies. In particular, we find that the amount of Fe depleted on to dust grains in the H II regions of the Magellanic Clouds is similar to that found in Galactic H II regions.},

abstract = {We have theoretically recalibrated the extragalactic H II region sequence and defined the theoretical boundary between objects excited by stars, and those exited by active galactic nuclei. We used both the PEGASE and STARBURST99 codes to generate the SED of the young star clusters, and MAPPINGS 3 to compute photoionization models which include a self-consistent treatment of dust physics and chemical depletion. We find that the two stellar spectral synthesis codes are in excellent agreement with each other for zero-age instantaneous age models. Also, the extragalactic H II region sequence is reproduced remarkably well by our models, provided that the clusters which excite them are all rather young (<2 Myr). This is most likely an observational selection effect. The line ratio usually used for measuring the ionization parameter, [O III] $\lambda$5007/[O II] $\lambda$$\lambda$3726, 3729, is indeed a good diagnostic. Amongst other easily observed line ratios we found that the [N II] $\lambda$$\lambda$6548, 6584/[O II] $\lambda$$\lambda$3726, 3729 ratio gives the best diagnostic of abundance, as it is monotonic between 0.1 and over 3.0 times solar metallicity. The extragalactic H II regions are characterized by abundances 0.1-2.5 solar and ionization parameters in the range 107< q < 108(or U = q/c in the range -3.5 < log U < -2.5).},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.This Letter presents a new, remarkably simple diagnostic specifically designed to derive chemical abundances for high redshift galaxies. It uses only the H$\alpha$$\mathrm{H}\alpha$, [N ii] and [S ii] emission lines, which can usually be observed in a single grating setting, and is almost linear up to an abundance of 12+log(O/H)=9.05$12+\log (\mathrm{O}/\mathrm{H}) = 9.05$. It can be used over the full abundance range encountered in high redshift galaxies. By its use of emission lines located close together in wavelength, it is also independent of reddening. Our diagnostic depends critically on the calibration of the N/O ratio. However, by using realistic stellar atmospheres combined with the N/O vs. O/H abundance calibration derived locally from stars and H ii regions, and allowing for the fact that high-redshift H ii regions have both high ionisation parameters and high gas pressures, we find that the observations of high-redshift galaxies can be simply explained by the models without having to invoke arbitrary changes in N/O ratio, or the presence of unusual quantities of Wolf-Rayet stars in these galaxies.},

abstract = {Physical dust models are presented for 65 galaxies in the SINGS survey that are strongly detected in the four IRAC bands and three MIPS bands. For each galaxy we estimate (1) the total dust mass, (2) the fraction of the dust mass contributed by PAHs, and (3) the intensity of the starlight heating the dust grains. We find that spiral galaxies have dust properties resembling the dust in the local region of the Milky Way, with similar dust-to-gas ratio, and similar PAH abundance. The observed SEDs, including galaxies with SCUBA photometry, can be reproduced by dust models that do not require "cold" (T<10K) dust.   The dust-to-gas ratio is observed to be dependent on metallicity. In the interstellar media of galaxies with A_O=12+log(O/H)>8.1, grains contain a substantial fraction of interstellar Mg, Si and Fe. Galaxies with A_O<8.1 and extended HI envelopes in some cases appear to have global dust-to-gas ratios that are low for their measured oxygen abundance, but in the regions where infrared emission is detected, the dust-to-gas ratio generally appears to be consistent with a substantial fraction of interstellar Mg, Si, and Fe being contained in dust. The PAH index q_PAH -- the fraction of the dust mass in the form of PAHs -- correlates with metallicity. The nine galaxies in our sample with A_O<8.1 have a median q_PAH=1.0%, whereas galaxies with A_O>8.1 have a median q_PAH=3.55%. The derived dust masses favor a value X_CO approx 4e20 cm^{-2}(K kms)^{-1} for the CO to H_2 conversion factor. Except for some starbursting systems (Mrk33, Tolo89, NGC3049), dust in the diffuse ISM dominates the IR power.},

abstract = {Infrared (IR) emission spectra are calculated for dust composed of mixtures of amorphous silicate and graphitic grains, including varying amounts of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) particles. The models are constrained to reproduce the average Milky Way extinction curve. The calculations include the effects of single-photon heating. Updated IR absorption properties for the PAHs are presented, that are consistent with observed emission spectra, including those newly obtained by Spitzer Space Telescope. We find a size distribution for the PAHs that results in emission band ratios consistent with observed spectra of the Milky Way and other galaxies. Emission spectra are presented for various intensities of the illuminating starlight. We calculate how the efficiency of emission into different IR bands depends on PAH size; the strong 7.7um emission feature is produced mainly by PAH particles containing <1000 C atoms. We show how the emission spectrum depends on U, the starlight intensity relative to the local interstellar radiation field. The submm and far-infrared emission is compared to the observed emission from the local interstellar medium. Using a simple distribution function, we calculate the emission spectrum for dust heated by a distribution of starlight intensities, such as occurs within galaxies. The models are parameterized by the PAH mass fraction qpah, the lower cutoff Umin, and the fraction gamma of the dust heated by starlight with U>Umin. We present graphical procedures using IRAC and MIPS photometry to estimate qpah, Umin, and gamma, the fraction f_PDR of the dust luminosity coming from photodissociation regions with U>100, and the total dust mass Mdust.},

abstract = {Destruction rates are estimated for interstellar dust grains as a function of size and composition of the grains, and the type of region in which the grain is located. Several idealized models of the interstellar medium are considered The destruction mechanisms examined include sputtering and grain-grain collisions in interstellar shocks, sputtering and sublimation in H II regions, photodesorption by UV, sputtering by cosmic rays, and sublimation during a supernova radiation pulse. Sublimation by the supernova radiation pulse is found to be very important for the more volatile mantle materials (binding energy U0 < 0.2 eV per molecule). For less volatile molecular ices (e.g. H20 with U0 $\sim$ 0.5 eV), photodesorption and sputtering in shock waves are the principal destruction mechanisms; photodesorption rates are uncertain by several orders of magnitude, however. Sputtering in high-velocity (vs > 150 km/s) shocks and grain-grain collisions in low-velocity (vs < 50 km/s) shocks account for most refractory grain destruction. Polymerized "HCO-material" is almost as resistant to sputtering as refractory grains. Water ice-mantles may be marginally able to survive in low-density H II regions (nh < 10 cm^-3), especially if the gas temperature is T < 10^3.8 K. The implications of these destruction rates for the survival of interstellar grains are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Charging of dust grains in hot (10,000-1 billion K) plasma is studied, including photoelectron and secondary electron emission, field emission, and transmission of electrons and ions through the grain. The resulting grain potentials are (for temperatures of at least about 100,000 K) considerably smaller in magnitude than found by Burke and Silk (1974). Even so, large electrostatic stresses can cause ion field emission and rapid destruction of small grains in very hot gas. Rapid rotation can also disrupt small grains, but damping (by microwave emission) usually limits the centrifugal stress to acceptable values for plasma densities of no more than about 1 per cu cm. Sputtering rates are estimated for grains in hot gas, based upon a semiempirical fit to experimental data. Predicted sputtering rates for possible grain constituents are similar to estimates by Barlow (1978), but in some cases differ significantly. Useful approximation formulas are given for the drag forces acting on a grain with arbitrary Mach number.},

abstract = {The observational constraints on interstellar dust are summarized. A dust model, consisting of a mixture of amorphous silicate, graphite, and PAH material that reproduces the observed interstellar extinction, is described. It is used to calculate the infrared emission expected when such dust is heated by radiation with the spectrum of interstellar starlight with various intensities. By adopting a suitable size distribution for the smallest carbonaceous grains (PAHs), and a distribution of starlight intensities, one can reproduce the observed global emission spectrum of galaxies. This allows the total dust mass, and the PAH abundance, to be estimated for any galaxy with a spectral energy distribution measured by the IRAC and MIPS cameras on Spitzer Space Telescope. For the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS) sample, galaxies with metallicities Z> 0.3 Z_ȯ tend to have a major fraction of their refractory elements in dust grains, just as in the Milky Way. For lower metallicity galaxies with extended H I envelopes, the overall dust-to-metals ratio remains uncertain. The PAH abundance index q_PAH (the fraction of the total dust mass in PAH particles with N_C<103 C atoms) is dependent on metallicity: galaxies with Z<0.3 Z_ȯ have median q_PAH=1.1%, whereas galaxies with Z>0.3 Z_ȯ have median q_PAH=3.5%. The reasons for the pronounced dependence of q_PAH on metallicity remain unclear.},

abstract = {From two very simple axioms: (1) that active galactic nucleus activity traces spheroid formation, and (2) that the cosmic star formation history is dominated by spheroid formation at high redshift, we derive simple expressions for the star formation histories of spheroids and discs, and their implied metal enrichment histories. Adopting a Baldry-Glazebrook initial mass function we use these relations and apply PEGASE.2 to predict the z = 0 cosmic spectral energy distributions (CSEDs) of spheroids and discs. The model predictions compare favourably to the dust-corrected CSED recently reported by the Galaxy And Mass Assembly team from the far-ultraviolet through to the K band. The model also provides a reasonable fit to the total stellar mass contained within spheroid and disc structures as recently reported by the Millennium Galaxy Catalogue team. Three interesting inferences can be made following our axioms: (1) there is a transition redshift at z ≈ 1.7 at which point the Universe switches from what we refer to as 'hot mode evolution's (i.e. spheroid formation/growth via mergers and/or collapse) to what we term 'cold mode evolution' (i.e. disc formation/growth via gas infall and minor mergers); (2) there is little or no need for any pre-enrichment prior to the main phase of star formation; (3) in the present Universe mass loss is fairly evenly balanced with star formation holding the integrated stellar mass density close to a constant value. The model provides a simple prediction of the energy output from spheroid and disc projenitors, the build-up of spheroid and disc mass and the mean metallicity enrichment of the Universe. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

abstract = {The Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) project is the latest in a tradition of large galaxy redshift surveys, and is now underway on the 3.9m Anglo-Australian Telescope at Siding Spring Observatory. GAMA is designed to map extragalactic structures on scales of 1kpc - 1Mpc in complete detail to a redshift of z$\sim$0.2, and to trace the distribution of luminous galaxies out to z$\sim$0.5. The principal science aim is to test the standard hierarchical structure formation paradigm of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) on scales of galaxy groups, pairs, discs, bulges and bars. We will measure (1) the Dark Matter Halo Mass Function (as inferred from galaxy group velocity dispersions); (2) baryonic processes, such as star formation and galaxy formation efficiency (as derived from Galaxy Stellar Mass Functions); and (3) the evolution of galaxy merger rates (via galaxy close pairs and galaxy asymmetries). Additionally, GAMA will form the central part of a new galaxy database, which aims to contain 275,000 galaxies with multi-wavelength coverage from coordinated observations with the latest international ground- and space-based facilities: GALEX, VST, VISTA, WISE, HERSCHEL, GMRT and ASKAP. Together, these data will provide increased depth (over 2 magnitudes), doubled spatial resolution (0.7"), and significantly extended wavelength coverage (UV through Far-IR to radio) over the main SDSS spectroscopic survey for five regions, each of around 50 deg^2. This database will permit detailed investigations of the structural, chemical, and dynamical properties of all galaxy types, across all environments, and over a 5 billion year timeline.},

abstract = {We present models for the evolution of the elemental abundances in the gas and dust phases of the interstellar medium (ISM) of our Galaxy by generalizing standard models for its dynamical and chemical evolution. In these models, the stellar birthrate history is determined by the infall rate of primordial gas, and by its functional dependence on the mass surface density of the stars and gas. We adopt a two component model for the Galaxy, consisting of a central bulge and an exponential disk with different infall rates and stellar birthrate histories. Condensation in stellar winds, Type Ia and Type II supernovae, and the accretion of refractory elements onto preexisting grains in dense molecular clouds are the dominant contributors to the abundance of elements locked up in the dust. Grain destruction by sputtering and evaporative grain-grain collisions in supernova remnants are the most important mechanisms that return these elements back to the gas phase. We calculate the dust production rate by the various dust sources, analyze the origin of the elemental depletion pattern, and study the relation between dust abundance and ISM metallicity, and the evolution of the the dust abundance and composition at each Galactocentric radius as a function of time. The derived relation of dust mass with metallicity is compared to the observed Galactic dust abundance gradient, and to the M$_{dust}$ versus log(O/H) relation that is observed in external Dwarf galaxies. The dependence of dust composition on the mass of the progenitor star, and the delayed recycling of newly synthesized dust by low mass stars back to the ISM give rise to variations in the dust composition as a function of time. Our models provide a framework for the self-consistent inclusion of dust in},

abstract = {We report the clear detection of the 2175 {\AA} dust absorption feature in the optical afterglow spectrum of the gamma-ray burst (GRB) GRB 070802 at a redshift of z = 2.45. This is the highest redshift for a detected 2175 {\AA} dust bump to date, and it is the first clear detection of the 2175 {\AA} bump in a GRB host galaxy, while several tens of optical afterglow spectra without the bump have been recorded in the past decade. The derived extinction curve gives A V = 0.8–1.5 depending on the assumed intrinsic slope. Of the three local extinction laws, a Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) type extinction gives the best fit to the extinction curve of the host of GRB 070802. Besides the 2175 {\AA} bump we find that the spectrum of GRB 070802 is characterized by unusually strong low-ionization metal lines and possibly a high metallicity for a GRB sightline ([Si/H] = −0.46 ± 0.38, [Zn/H] = −0.50 ± 0.68). In particular, the spectrum of GRB 070802 is unique for a GRB spectrum in that it shows clear C i absorption features, leading us to propose a correlation between the presence of the bump and C i. The gas-to-dust ratio for the host galaxy is found to be significantly lower than that of other GRB hosts with N(H i)/A V = (2.4 ± 1.0) × 10 21 cm −2 mag −1 , which lies between typical Milky Way and LMC values. Our results are in agreement with the tentative conclusion reached by Gordon et al. that the shape of the extinction curve, in particular the presence of the bump, is affected by the UV flux density in the environment of the dust.},

abstract = {Context. To answer questions on the start and duration of the epoch of reionisation, periods of galaxy mergers and properties of other cosmological encounters, the cosmic star formation history, $\rho$̇* or CSFH, is of fundamental importance. Using the association of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) with the death of massive stars and their ultra-luminous nature ( > 10 52 ergs -1 ), the CSFH can be probed to higher redshifts than current conventional methods. Unfortunately, no consensus has been reached on the manner in which the LGRB rate, $\rho$̇ grb or LGRBR, traces the CSFH, leaving many of the questions mentioned mostly unexplored by this method. Aims. Observations by the gamma-ray burst near-infrared detector (GROND) over the past 4 years have, for the first time, acquired highly complete LGRB samples. Driven by these completeness levels and new evidence of LGRBs also occurring in more massive and metal rich galaxies than previously thought, the possible biases of the $\rho$ grb - $\rho$̇ * connection are investigated over a large range of galaxy properties. Methods. The CSFH is modelled using empirical fits to the galaxy mass function and galaxy star formation rates. Biasing the CSFH by means of metallicity cuts, mass range boundaries, and other unknown redshift dependencies of the form $\rho$̇ grb ∝ $\rho$̇ * (1+z) $\delta$ a $\rho$̇ grb is generated and compared to the highly complete GROND LGRB sample. Results. It is found that there is no strong preference for a metallicity cut or fixed galaxy mass boundaries and that there are no unknown redshift effects ($\delta$ = 0), in contrast to previous work which suggest values of Z/Z ⊙ ∼ 0.1-0.3. From the best-fit models obtained, we predict that ∼1.2% of the LGRB burst sample exists above z = 6. Conclusions. The linear relationship between $\rho$̇ grb and $\rho$̇ * suggested by our results implies that redshift biases present in previous LGRB samples significantly affect the inferred dependencies of LGRBs on their host galaxy properties. Such biases can lead to, for example, an interpretation of metallicity limitations and evolving LGRB luminosity functions. {\textcopyright} 2012 ESO.},

abstract = {Metallicity is theoretically thought to be a fundamental driver in gamma-ray burst (GRB) explosions and energetics, but is still, even after more than a decade of extensive studies, not fully understood. This is largely related to two phenomena: a dust-extinction bias, that prevented high-mass and thus likely high-metallicity GRB hosts to be detected in the first place, and a lack of efficient instrumentation, that limited spectroscopic studies including metallicity measurements to the low-redshift end of the GRB host population. The subject of this work is the very energetic GRB 110918A, for which we measure a redshift of z=0.984. GRB 110918A gave rise to a luminous afterglow with an intrinsic spectral slope of b=0.70, which probed a sight-line with little extinction (A_V=0.16 mag) typical of the established distributions of afterglow properties. Photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations of the galaxy hosting GRB 110918A, including optical/NIR photometry with GROND and spectroscopy with VLT/X-shooter, however, reveal an all but average GRB host in comparison to the z$\sim$1 galaxies selected through similar afterglows to date. It has a large spatial extent with a half-light radius of $\sim$10 kpc, the highest stellar mass for z<1.9 (log(M_*/M_sol) = 10.68+-0.16), and an Halpha-based star formation rate of 41 M_sol/yr. We measure a gas-phase extinction of $\sim$1.8 mag through the Balmer decrement and one of the largest host-integrated metallicities ever of around solar (12 + log(O/H) = 8.93+/-0.13). This presents one of the very few robust metallicity measurements of GRB hosts at z$\sim$1, and establishes that GRB hosts at z$\sim$1 can also be very metal rich. It conclusively rules out a metallicity cut-off in GRB host galaxies and argues against an anti-correlation between metallicity and energy release in GRBs.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT We present high-resolution echelle spectra of seven proximate damped Lyman $\alpha$ (PDLA) systems. The relative velocity separation of each PDLA from the background quasar is $\Delta$ V < 3000 km s-1. Combining our sample with a further nine PDLAs from the literature we compare the chemical properties of the proximate systems with a control sample of intervening DLAs. The PDLAs are usually excluded from statistical studies of absorption-selected galaxies and this sample constitutes the first systematic study of their chemical and ionization properties. Taken at face value, the sample of 16 PDLAs exhibits a wide range of metallicities, ranging from Z $\sim$ 1/3 to $\sim$ 1/1000 Zsolar, including the DLA with the lowest N(SiII)/N(HI) yet reported in the literature. However, some of these abundances may require ionization corrections. We find several pieces of evidence that indicate enhanced ionization and the presence of a hard ionizing spectrum in PDLAs which lead to properties that contrast with the intervening DLAs, particularly when the N(HI) is low. The abundances of Zn, Si and S in PDLAs with log N(HI) > 21, where ionization corrections are minimized, are systematically higher than the intervening population by a factor of around 3. We also find possible evidence for a higher fraction of NV absorbers amongst the PDLAs, although the statistics are still modest. 6/7 of our echelle sample show high ionization species (SiIV, CIV, OVI or NV) offset by >100 km s-1 from the main low ion absorption. We analyse fine-structure transitions of CII* and SiII* to constrain the PDLA distance from the quasi-stellar object (QSO). Lower limits range from tens of kpc to >160 kpc for the most stringent limit. We conclude that (at least some) PDLAs do exhibit different characteristics relative to the intervening population out to 3000 kms-1 (and possibly beyond). None the less, the PDLAs appear distinct from lower column density associated systems, and the inferred QSO-absorber separations mean they are unlikely to be associated with the QSO host. No trends with $\Delta$ V are found, although this requires a larger sample with better emission redshifts to confirm. We speculate that the PDLAs preferentially sample more massive galaxies in more highly clustered regions of the high-redshift Universe.

abstract = {Composite spectra of 85 proximate absorbers [log N(H I) ≥ 20 cm-2 and velocity difference between the absorption and emission redshifts, $\Delta$V < 10 000 km s-1] in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey are used to investigate the trends of metal-line strengths with velocity separation from the quasi-stellar object (QSO). We construct composites in three velocity bins: $\Delta$V < 3000 km s-1, 3000 < $\Delta$V < 6000 km s-1 and $\Delta$V > 6000 km s-1, with further sub-samples to investigate the metal-line dependence on N(H I) and QSO luminosity. Low (e.g. Si II and Fe II) and high ionization (e.g. Si IV and C IV) species alike have equivalent widths (EWs) that are larger by factors of 1.5-3 in the $\Delta$V < 3000 km s-1 composite, compared to the $\Delta$V > 6000 km s-1 spectrum. The EWs show an even stronger dependence on $\Delta$V if only the highest neutral hydrogen column density [log N(H I) ≥ 20.7] absorbers are considered. We conclude that proximate damped Lyman $\alpha$ systems (PDLAs) generally have higher metallicities than intervening absorbers, with the enhancement being a function of both $\Delta$V and N(H I). It is also found that absorbers near QSOs with lower rest-frame UV luminosities have significantly stronger metal lines. We speculate that absorbers near to high luminosity QSOs may have had their star formation prematurely quenched. There is no evidence for Ly$\alpha$ emission in the trough of the composite spectrum. Finally, we search for the signature of dust reddening by the PDLAs, based on an analysis of the QSO continuum slopes relative to a control sample, and determine a limit of E(B-V) < 0.014 for a Small Magellanic Cloud extinction curve. This work provides an empirical motivation for distinguishing between proximate and intervening DLAs and establishes a connection between the QSO environment and galaxy properties at high redshifts.},

abstract = {We have computed an extensive, homogeneous grid of theoretical photoionization models with conditions appropriate to observed H n regions. This grid has been used to develop a comprehensive set of theoretical diagnostic diagrams for H n regions, which employ ratios of prominent emission lines to determine the ionization parameter within the nebula, and the ionization temperature of its exciting star(s). It is also possible to estimate the element-averaged metallicity in the nebula and stars from these diagnostics. We construct theoretical loci for H n regions on the principal excitation diagrams of Baldwin, Phillips, and Terlevich (1981) and confirm that the theoretical models overlie the observed distribution of H n regions on these diagrams. Comparison of current observational data with the theoretical models on these and other diagrams implies the existence of a correlation between element-averaged metallicity and mean ionization parameter. The data also suggest that the ionization temperature of the exciting star(s) in the ionizing OB associations of H n regions is approximately constant and independent of metallicity and ionization parameter for the range of conditions considered here.},

abstract = {We present a homogeneous X-ray analysis of all 318 Gamma Ray Bursts detected by the X-ray Telescope on the Swift satellite up to 2008 July 23; this represents the largest sample of X-ray GRB data published to date. In Sections 2--3 we detail the methods which the Swift-XRT team has developed to produce the enhanced positions, light curves, hardness ratios and spectra presented in this paper. Software using these methods continues to create such products for all new GRBs observed by the Swift-XRT. We also detail web-based tools allowing users to create these products for any object observed by the XRT, not just GRBs. In Sections 4--6 we present the results of our analysis of GRBs, including probability distribution functions of the temporal and spectral properties of the sample. We demonstrate evidence for a consistent underlying behaviour which can produce a range of light curve morphologies, and attempt to interpret this behaviour in the framework of external forward shock emission. We find several difficulties, in particular that reconciliation of our data with the forward shock model requires energy injection to continue for days to weeks.},

abstract = {We utilize the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) to search for extended Lyman-Alpha emission around the z$\sim$6.6 QSO J0305-3150. After carefully subtracting the point-spread-function, we reach a nominal 5-sigma surface brightness limit of SB = 1.9x10$^{-18}$ erg/s/cm$^2$/arcsec$^2$ over a 1 arcsec$^2$ aperture, collapsing 5 wavelength slices centered at the expected location of the redshifted Lyman-Alpha emission (i.e. at 9256 Ang.). Current data suggest the presence (5-sigma, accounting for systematics) of a Lyman-Alpha nebula that extends for 9 kpc around the QSO. This emission is displaced and redshifted by 155 km/s with respect to the location of the QSO host galaxy traced by the [CII] emission line. The total luminosity is L = 3.0x10$^{42}$ erg/s. Our analysis suggests that this emission is unlikely to rise from optically thick clouds illuminated by the ionizing radiation of the QSO. It is more plausible that the Lyman-Alpha emission is due to fluorescence of the highly ionized optically thin gas. This scenario implies a high hydrogen volume density of n$_H$ $\sim$ 6 cm$^{-3}$. In addition, we detect a Lyman-Alpha emitter (LAE) in the immediate vicinity of the QSO: i.e., with a projected separation of 12.5 kpc and a line-of-sight velocity difference of 560 km/s. The luminosity of the LAE is L = 2.1x10$^{42}$ erg/s and its inferred star-formation-rate is SFR $\sim$ 1.3 M$_\odot$/yr. The probability of finding such a close LAE is one order of magnitude above the expectations based on the QSO-galaxy cross-correlation function. This discovery is in agreement with a scenario where dissipative interactions favour the rapid build-up of super-massive black holes at early Cosmic times.},

abstract = {We use a suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to quantify the accretion rates of baryons into dark matter halos and the resulting baryon mass fractions, as a function of halo mass, redshift, and baryon type (including cold and hot gas). We find that the net baryonic accretion rates through the virial radius are sensitive to galactic outflows and explore a range of outflow parameters to illustrate the effects. We show that the cold gas accretion rate is in general not a simple universal factor of the dark matter accretion rate, and that galactic winds can cause star formation rates to deviate significantly from the external gas accretion rates, both via gas ejection and re-accretion. Furthermore, galactic winds can inject enough energy and momentum in the surrounding medium to slow down accretion altogether, especially in low-mass halos and at low redshift. By resolving the accretion rates versus radius from the halo centers, we show how cold streams penetrate the hot atmospheres of massive halos at z>2, but gradually disappear at lower redshift. The total baryon mass fraction is also strongly suppressed by outflows in low-mass halos, but is nearly universal in the absence of feedback in halos above the UV background suppression scale. The transition halo mass, at which the gas mass in halos is equal for the cold and hot components, is roughly constant at $\sim$10^11.5 Msun and does not depend sensitively on the wind prescription. We provide simple fitting formulae for the cold gas accretion rate into halos in the no-wind case. Finally, we show that cold accretion is broadly consistent with driving the bulk of the highly star-forming galaxies observed at z$\sim$2, but that the more intense star formers likely sample the high end of the accretion rate distribution, and may be additionally fueled by a combination of gas recycling, gas re-accretion, hot mode cooling, and mergers.},

abstract = {Most galaxy evolution simulations as well as a variety of observational methods assume a linear scaling between the (galaxy-averaged) dust-to-gas ratio D and metallicity Z of the interstellar medium (ISM). Indeed, nearby galaxies with solar or moderately sub-solar metallicities clearly follow this trend albeit with significant scatter. However, a growing number of observations show that the linear scaling breaks down for metal-poor galaxies (Z<0.2 Z_sun), highlighting the need for a more sophisticated modeling of the dust-to-metal ratio of galaxies. Here we study the co-evolution of dust and metal abundances in galaxies with the help of a dynamical, one-zone model that incorporates dust formation and destruction processes in addition to gas inflows, outflows, and metal enrichment. The dynamical model is consistent with various observational constraints, including the stellar mass -- metallicity relation, the stellar mass -- halo mass relation, and the observed Z -- D relation for both metal-poor and metal-rich galaxies. The functional form of the Z -- D relation follows from a basic equilibrium ansatz, similar to the ideas used previously to model the stellar mass -- metallicity relation. Galactic outflows regulate the inflow rate of gas from the cosmic web for galaxies of a given star formation rate. The mass loading factor of outflows thus dictates the rate at which the dust and metal content of the ISM is diluted. The stellar mass dependence of the mass loading factor drives the evolution of metallicities, dust-to-gas ratios, and dust-to-metal ratios in galaxies.},

abstract = {We describe the 2017 release of the spectral synthesis code Cloudy. A major development since the previous release has been exporting the atomic data into external data files. This greatly simplifies updates and maintenance of the data. Many large datasets have been incorporated with the result that we can now predict well over an order of magnitude more emission lines when all databases are fully used. The use of such large datasets is not realistic for most calculations due to the time and memory needs, and we describe the limited subset of data we use by default. Despite the fact that we now predict significantly more lines than the previous Cloudy release, this version is faster because of optimization of memory access patterns and other tuning. The size and use of the databases can easily be adjusted in the command-line interface. We give examples of the accuracy limits using small models, and the performance requirements of large complete models. We summarize several advances in the H- and He-like iso-electronic sequences. We use our complete collisional-radiative models of the ionization of these one and two-electron ions to establish the highest density for which the coronal or interstellar medium (ISM) approximation works, and the lowest density where Saha or local thermodynamic equilibrium can be assumed. The coronal approximation fails at surprisingly low densities for collisional ionization equilibrium but is valid to higher densities for photoionized gas clouds. Many other improvements to the physics have been made and are described. These include the treatment of isotropic continuum sources such as the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in the reported output, and the ability to follow the evolution of cooling non-equilibrium clouds.},

abstract = {Dust growth via accretion of gas species has been proposed as the dominant process to increase the amount of dust in galaxies. We show here that this hypothesis encounters severe difficulties that make it unfit to explain the observed UV and IR properties of such systems, particularly at high redshifts. Dust growth in the diffuse ISM phases is hampered by (a) too slow accretion rates; (b) too high dust temperatures, and (c) the Coulomb barrier that effectively blocks accretion. In molecular clouds these problems are largely alleviated. Grains are cold (but not colder than the CMB temperature, (Tcmb = 20 K at redshift z=6). However, in dense environments accreted materials form icy water mantles, perhaps with impurities. Mantles are immediately photo-desorbed as grains return to the diffuse ISM at the end of the cloud lifetime, thus erasing any memory of the growth. We conclude that dust attenuating stellar light at high-$z$ must be ready-made stardust largely produced in supernova ejecta.},

abstract = {The long and relatively faint gamma-ray burst GRB 060605 detected by Swift/BAT lasted about 20 s. Its afterglow could be observed with Swift/XRT for nearly 1 day, while Swift/UVOT could detect the afterglow during the first 6 h after the event. Here, we report on integral field spectroscopy of its afterglow performed with PMAS/PPak mounted at the Calar Alto 3.5 m telescope. In addition, we report on a detailed analysis of XRT and UVOT data and on the results of deep late-time VLT observations that reveal the GRB host galaxy. We find that the burst occurred at a redshift of z, possibly associated with a faint, R c = 26.4 ± 0.3 host. Based on the optical and X-ray data, we deduce information on the SED of the afterglow, the position of the cooling frequency in the SED, the nature of the circumburst environment, its collimation factor, and its energetics. We find that the GRB fireball was expanding into a constant-density medium and that the explosion was collimated with a narrow half-opening angle of about 2.4 degrees. The initial Lorentz factor of the fireball was about 250; however, its beaming-corrected energy release in the gamma-ray band was comparably low. The optical, X-ray afterglow, on the other hand, was rather luminous. Finally, we find that the data are consistent within the error bars with an achromatic evolution of the afterglow during the suspected jet break time at about 0.27 days after the burst. {\textcopyright} 2009 ESO.},

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA.

Using deep observations (27 hours) of the Hubble Deep Field South from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument, we identify signatures of an outflow in both emission and absorption from a spatially resolved galaxy at z = 1.29 with a stellar mass M* = 8 x 10^9 Msun, star formation rate SFR = 77 Msun/yr, and star formation rate surface brightness 1.6 Msun/kpc^2 within the [OII] half-light radius R_1/2,[OII] = 2.76 +- 0.17 kpc. From a component of the strong resonant MgII and FeII absorptions at -350 km/s, we infer a mass outflow rate that is comparable to the star formation rate. We detect non-resonant FeII* emission, at lambda 2626, 2612, 2396, and 2365, at 1.2-2.4-1.5-2.7 x 10^-18 egs s-1 cm-2 respectively. These flux ratios are consistent with the expectations for optically thick gas. By combining the four non-resonant FeII* emission lines, we spatially map the FeII* emission from an individual galaxy for the first time. The FeII* emission has an elliptical morphology that is roughly aligned with the galaxy minor kinematic axis, and its integrated half-light radius R_1/2,FeII* = 4.1 +- 0.4 kpc is 50% larger than the stellar continuum (R_1/2,* = 2.34 +- 0.17 kpc) or the [OII] nebular line. Moreover, the FeII* emission shows a blue wing extending up to -400 km/s, which is more pronounced along the galaxy minor kinematic axis and reveals a C-shaped pattern in a p-v diagram along that axis. These features are consistent with a bi-conical outflow.},

Its main originality is the extension to the near-infrared (NIR) of the atlas of synthetic spectra of Rocca-Volmerange & Guiderdoni (1988) with a revised stellar library including cold star parameters and stellar tracks extended to the thermally-pulsing regime of the asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) and the post-AGB (PAGB) phase. The NIR is coherently linked to the visible and the ultraviolet (UV), so that the model is continuous on an exceptionally large wavelength range from 220 {\AA} up to 5 $\mu$n. Moreover, a precise algorithm allows to follow very rapid evolutionary phases such as red supergiants or AGB crucial in the NIR. The nebular component is also computed in the NIR. The extinction correction is gas-dependent for spirals and ellipticals. A set of reference synthetic spectra at z = 0, to which apply cosmological k- and evolution e- corrections for high-redshift galaxies, is built from fits of observational templates. Because of the lack of visible to NIR spectral templates for each Hubble type, we adopt statistical samples of colors, not fitted by previous models. A first application of this continuous model is to solve the problem of the slope of the bright galaxy counts from B = 15 to 19 and of the normalization parameter {\O}* of the Schechter luminosity function. Designed to be used currently and to take into account easily new observational and theoretical inputs, the model is built as a series of independent blocks. Any block is clearly identified and submitted to publication.

abstract = {We present a new method aimed at handling long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) as cosmic rulers. The recent discovery of a tight correlation between the collimation-corrected GRB energy and the peak of the gamma-ray spectrum has opened up the possibility of using GRBs as a new category of standard candles. Unfortunately, because of the lack of low-z GRBs, up to now this correlation has been obtained from high-z GRBs, with the consequence that it depends on the cosmological parameters we pretend to constrain. It is hoped that this circularity problem will be solved when, in a few years, the low-z GRB sample will be increased enough. In the meantime, we present here a new Bayesian method that eases the aforesaid circularity problem, and allows the introduction of new constraints on the cosmological ($\Omega$M, $\Omega$$\Lambda$) diagram as well as the exploration of the kinematics of the Universe up to z$\sim$ 3. The method that we propose offers the further advantage of allowing us to handle the problem of the ($\Omega$M, $\Omega$$\Lambda$) loitering line singularity which inevitably appears when standard candles with z > 2 are used. The combination of GRBs with Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) data makes the popular $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology more consistent with the Hubble diagram at the 68 per cent confidence level. For a flat cosmology we find $\Omega$M= 0.28 +/- 0.03 for the combined GRB+SN Ia data set. Correspondingly, the transition redshift between cosmic deceleration and acceleration is zT= 0.73 +/- 0.09, slightly larger than the value found by considering SNe Ia alone. We briefly discuss our results also in terms of non-$\Lambda$CDM dark energy models.},

abstract = {We study the IR-through-UV wavelength dependence of 328 Galactic interstellar extinction curves affecting normal, near-main-sequence B and late O stars. We derive the curves using a new technique that employs stellar atmosphere models in lieu of unreddened ''standard'' stars. Under ideal conditions, this technique is capable of virtually eliminating spectral mismatch errors in the curves. In general, it lends itself to a quantitative assessment of the errors and enables a rigorous testing of the significance of relationships between various curve parameters, re-gardless of whether their uncertainties are correlated. Analysis of the curves gives the following results: 1. In accord with our previous findings, the central position of the 2175 8 extinction bump is mildly variable, its width is highly variable, and the two variations are unrelated. 2. Strong correlations are found among some extinction properties within the UV region, and within the IR region. 3. With the exception of a few curves with extreme (i.e., large) values of R(V), the UVand IR portions of Galactic extinction curves are not correlated with each other. 4. The large sight lineYtoYsight line variation seen in our sample implies that any average Galactic extinction curve will always reflect the biases of its parent sample. 5. The use of an average curve to deredden a spectral energy distribution (SED) will result in significant errors, and a realistic error budget for the dereddened SED must include the observed variance of Galactic curves. While the observed large sight lineYtoYsight line variations, and the lack of correlation among the various features of the curves, make it difficult to meaningfully characterize average extinction properties, they demonstrate that extinction curves respond sensitively to local conditions. Thus, each curve contains potentially unique information about the grains along its sight line.},

abstract = {We present a study of C IV absorption in a sample of 63 damped Lyman-$\alpha$ (DLA) systems and 11 sub-DLAs in the redshift range 1.75<z_abs<3.61, using a dataset of high-resolution (6.6 km s-1 FWHM), high signal-to-noise VLT/UVES spectra. The complex absorption line profiles show both narrow and broad C IV components, indicating the presence of both warm, photoionized and hot, collisionally ionized gas. We report new correlations between the metallicity (measured in the neutral-phase) and each of the C IV column density, the C IV total line width, and the maximum C IV velocity. We explore the effect on these correlations of the sub-DLAs, the proximate DLAs (defined as those within 5000 km s-1 of the quasar), the saturated absorbers, and the metal line used to measure the metallicity, and we find the correlations to be robust. There is no evidence for any difference between the measured properties of DLA C IV and sub-DLA C IV. In 25 DLAs and 4 sub-DLAs, covering 2.5 dex in [Z/H], we directly observe C IV moving above the escape speed, where v_esc is derived from the total line width of the neutral gas profiles. These high-velocity C IV clouds, unbound from the central potential well, can be interpreted as highly ionized outflowing winds, which are predicted by numerical simulations of galaxy feedback. The distribution of C IV column density in DLAs and sub-DLAs is similar to the distribution in Lyman Break galaxies, where winds are directly observed, supporting the idea that supernova feedback creates the ionized gas in DLAs. The unbound C IV absorbers show a median mass flow rate of $\sim$22 (r/40 kpc) M_sun yr-1, where r is the characteristic C IV radius. Their kinetic energy fluxes are large enough that a star formation rate (SFR) of $\sim$2 M_sun yr-1 is required to power them.

abstract = {We present Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer and Hubble Space Telescope observations of high-, intermediate-, and low-ion absorption in high-velocity cloud (HVC) Complex C along the lines of sight toward five active galaxies. Our purpose is to investigate the idea that Complex C is surrounded by an envelope of highly ionized material, arising from the interaction between the cloud and a hot surrounding medium. We measure column densities of high-velocity high-ion absorption and compare the kinematics of low-, intermediate-, and high-ionization gas along the five sight lines. We find that in all five cases, the H I and O VI high-velocity components are centered within 20 km s-1 of one another, with an average displacement of OVI-vHI>=3+/-12 km s-1. In those directions where the H I emission extends to more negative velocities (the so-called high-velocity ridge), so does the O VI absorption. The kinematics of Si II is also similar to that of O VI, with OVI-vSiII>=0+/-15 km s-1. We compare our high-ion column density ratios to the predictions of various models, adjusted to account for both recent updates to the solar elemental abundances and relative elemental abundance ratios in Complex C. Along the PG 1259+593 sight line, we measure N(SiIV)/N(OVI)=0.10+/-0.02, N(CIV)/N(OVI)=0.35+0.05-0.06, and N(NV)/N(OVI)<0.07 (3 $\sigma$). These ratios are inconsistent with collisional ionization equilibrium at one kinetic temperature. Photoionization by the extragalactic background is ruled out as the source of the high ions since the path lengths required would make HVCs unreasonably large; photoionization by radiation from the disk of the Galaxy also appears unlikely since the emerging photons are not energetic enough to produce O VI. By themselves, ionic ratios are insufficient to discriminate between various ionization models, but by considering the absorption kinematics as well, we consider the most likely origin for the highly ionized high-velocity gas to be at the conductive or turbulent interfaces between the neutral/warm ionized components of Complex C and a surrounding hot medium. The presence of interfaces on the surface of HVCs provides indirect evidence for the existence of a hot medium in which the HVCs are immersed. This medium could be a hot (T>$\sim$106 K) extended Galactic corona or hot gas in the Local Group. Based on observations from the NASA-CNES-CSA Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer mission, operated by Johns Hopkins University, supported by NASA contract NAS 5-32985, and from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

abstract = {AT 2018cow is a unique transient that stands out due to its relatively fast light curve, high peak bolometric luminosity, and blue colour. These properties distinguish it from typical radioactively powered core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Instead, the characteristics are more similar to a growing sample of Fast Blue Optical Transients (FBOTs). Mostly discovered at hundreds of Mpc, FBOT follow-up is usually limited to several photometry points and low signal-to-noise spectra. At only ∼60 Mpc, AT 2018cow offers an opportunity for detailed follow-up. Studies of this object published to date propose a number of interpretations for AT 2018cow, but none of these specifically consider the interacting Type Ibn SN subclass. We point out that while narrow lines do not dominate the spectrum of AT 2018cow, as narrow Balmer lines typically do in SNe IIn, the narrow lines in AT 2018cow may nevertheless include emission from pre-shock CSM. In particular, the He i lines in AT 2018cow are broader than H ii region lines in the same spectrum, and they closely resemble He i lines in some examples of SNe Ibn or transitional SNe Ibn/IIn objects. We compare AT 2018cow to interacting SNe Ibn and IIn and find a number of noteworthy similarities, including light-curve rise and fall times, peak magnitude, X-ray light curves, and spectroscopic properties. We therefore explore the hypothesis that CSM interaction in a relatively H-poor system might help explain some observed properties of AT 2018cow, and we go on to consider progenitor implications for AT 2018cow, FBOTs, and SNe Ibn.},

abstract = {For most of their lives, galaxies are surrounded by large and massive coronae of hot gas, which constitute vast reservoirs for gas accretion. This Chapter describes a mechanism that allows star-forming disc galaxies to extract gas from their coronae. Stellar feedback powers a continuous circulation (galactic fountain) of gas from the disc into the halo, producing mixing between metal-rich disc material and metal-poor coronal gas. This mixing causes a dramatic reduction of the cooling time of the corona making it condense and accrete onto the disc. This fountain- driven accretion model makes clear predictions for the kinematics of the extraplanar cold/warm gas in disc galaxies, which are in good agreement with a number of independent observations. The amount of gas accretion predicted by the model is of the order of what is needed to sustain star formation. Accretion is expected to occur preferentially in the outer parts of discs and its efficiency drops for higher coronal temperatures. Thus galaxies are able to gather new gas as long as they do not become too massive nor fall into large halos and maintain their star-forming gaseous discs.},

abstract = {Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) are transient events observed when a star passes close enough to a supermassive black hole to be tidally destroyed. Many TDE candidates have been discovered in host galaxies whose spectra have weak or no line emission yet strong Balmer line absorption, indicating a period of intense star formation that has recently ended. As such, TDE host galaxies fall into the rare class of quiescent Balmer-strong galaxies. Here, we quantify the fraction of galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with spectral properties like those of TDE hosts, determining the extent to which TDEs are over-represented in such galaxies. Galaxies whose spectra have Balmer absorption H$\delta_{\rm A}$ $-$ $\sigma$(H$\delta_{\rm A}$) $>$ 4 \AA\ (where $\sigma$(H$\delta_{\rm A}$) is the error in the Lick H$\delta_{\rm A}$ index) and H$\alpha$ emission EW $<$ $3$ \AA\ have had a strong starburst in the last $\sim$Gyr. They represent 0.2% of the local galaxy population, yet host 3 of 8 (37.5%) optical/UV-selected TDE candidates. A broader cut, H$\delta_{\rm A} >$ 1.31 \AA\ and H$\alpha$ EW $<$ $3$ \AA, nets only 2.3% of SDSS galaxies, but 6 of 8 (75%) optical/UV TDE hosts. Thus, quiescent Balmer-strong galaxies are over-represented among the TDE hosts by a factor of 33-190. The high-energy-selected TDE Swift J1644 also lies in a galaxy with strong Balmer lines and weak H$\alpha$ emission, implying a $>80\times$ enhancement in such hosts and providing an observational link between the $\gamma$/X-ray-bright and optical/UV-bright TDE classes.},

Using spectroscopic and imaging observations of the afterglow and host of the long-duration Swift GRB 121024A at z = 2.30, we give one of the most complete views of a GRB host/environment to date. We observe a strong damped Ly$\alpha$ absorber (DLA) with a hydrogen column density of log N(Hi) = 21.88 ± 0.10, H<inf>2</inf> absorption in the Lyman-Werner bands (molecular fraction of log(f) ≈ -1.4; fourth solid detection of molecular hydrogen in a GRB-DLA), the nebular emission lines Ha, H$\beta$, [O II], [O III] and [N II], as well as metal absorption lines. We find aGRB host galaxy that is highly star forming (SFR $\sim$ 40M<inf>⊙</inf> yr<sup>-1</sup>), with a dust-corrected metallicity along the line of sight of [Zn/H]<inf>corr</inf> =-0.6 ± 0.2 ([O/H] $\sim$ -0.3 from emission lines), and a depletion factor [Zn/Fe] = 0.85 ± 0.04. The molecular gas is separated by 400 km s<sup>-1</sup> (and 1-3 kpc) from the gas that is photoexcited by the GRB. This implies a fairly massive host, in agreement with the derived stellar mass of log(M<inf>*</inf>/M<inf>⊙</inf>) = 9.9<inf>-0.3</inf><sup>+0.2</sup>. We dissect the host galaxy by characterizing its molecular component, the excited gas, and the line-emitting star-forming regions. The extinction curve for the line of sight is found to be unusually flat (R<inf>V</inf> $\sim$ 15). We discuss the possibility of an anomalous grain size distributions.

abstract = {When massive stars exhaust their fuel they collapse and often produce the extraordinarily bright explosions known as core-collapse supernovae. On occasion, this stellar collapse also powers an even more brilliant relativistic explosion known as a long-duration gamma-ray burst. One would then expect that long gamma-ray bursts and core-collapse supernovae should be found in similar galactic environments. Here we show that this expectation is wrong. We find that the long gamma-ray bursts are far more concentrated on the very brightest regions of their host galaxies than are the core-collapse supernovae. Furthermore, the host galaxies of the long gamma-ray bursts are significantly fainter and more irregular than the hosts of the core-collapse supernovae. Together these results suggest that long-duration gamma-ray bursts are associated with the most massive stars and may be restricted to galaxies of limited chemical evolution. Our results directly imply that long gamma-ray bursts are relatively rare in galaxies such as our own Milky Way.},

abstract = {We report on Hubble Space Telescope and Palomar optical images of the\nfield of GRB 990123, obtained in 1999 February 8 and 9. We find that the\noptical transient (OT) associated with GRB 990123 is located on an\nirregular galaxy, with a magnitude of V=24.20+/-0.15. The strong metal\nabsorption lines seen in the spectrum of the OT, along with the low\nprobability of a chance superposition, lead us to conclude that this\ngalaxy is the host of the gamma-ray burst (GRB). The OT is projected\nwithin the $\sim$1'' visible stellar field of the host, nearer the edge than\nthe center. We cannot, on this basis, rule out the galactic nucleus as\nthe site of the GRB, since the unusual morphology of the host may be the\nresult of an ongoing galactic merger, but our demonstration that this\nhost galaxy has extremely blue optical-to-infrared colors more strongly\nsupports an association between GRBs and star formation. We find that\nthe OT magnitude in 1999 February 9.05, V=25.45+/-0.15, is about 1.5 mag\nfainter than expected from the extrapolation of the decay rate found in\nearlier observations. A detailed analysis of the OT light curve suggests\nthat its fading has gone through three distinct phases: an early, rapid\ndecline (f_nu$\sim$t^-1.6 for t{\lt}0.1 days); a slower, intermediate decline\npower-law decay (f_nu$\sim$t^-1.1 for 0.1{\lt}t{\lt}2 days); and then a more\nrapid decay (at least as steep as f_nu$\sim$t^-1.8 for t{\gt}2 days). The\nbreak to a steeper slope at late times may provide evidence that the\noptical emission from this GRB was highly beamed.\n},

abstract = {We present low-resolution near-infrared stacked spectra from the 3D-HST survey up to $z=2.0$ and fit them with commonly used stellar population synthesis models: BC03 (Bruzual & Charlot, 2003), FSPS10 (Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis, Conroy & Gunn 2010), and FSPS-C3K (Conroy, Kurucz, Cargile, Castelli, in prep). The accuracy of the grism redshifts allows the unambiguous detection of many emission and absorption features, and thus a first systematic exploration of the rest-frame optical spectra of galaxies up to $z=2$. We select massive galaxies ($\rm log(M_{*} / M_{\odot}) > 10.8$), we divide them into quiescent and star-forming via a rest-frame color-color technique, and we median-stack the samples in 3 redshift bins between $z=0.5$ and $z=2.0$. We find that stellar population models fit the observations well at wavelengths below $\rm 6500 \AA$ rest-frame, but show systematic residuals at redder wavelengths. The FSPS-C3K model generally provides the best fits (evaluated with a $\chi^2_{red}$ statistics) for quiescent galaxies, while BC03 performs the best for star-forming galaxies. The stellar ages of quiescent galaxies implied by the models, assuming solar metallicity, vary from 4 Gyr at $z \sim 0.75$ to 1.5 Gyr at $z \sim 1.75$, with an uncertainty of a factor of 2 caused by the unknown metallicity. On average the stellar ages are half the age of the Universe at these redshifts. We show that the inferred evolution of ages of quiescent galaxies is in agreement with fundamental plane measurements, assuming an 8 Gyr age for local galaxies. For star-forming galaxies the inferred ages depend strongly on the stellar population model and the shape of the assumed star-formation history.},

With a 5-hour MUSE integration in a $\sim$500x500 kpc^2 region centred at the quasar position, we achieve a >80% complete spectroscopic survey of continuum-detected galaxies with m<25 mag and Ly{\alpha} emitters with luminosity L>3e41 erg/s. We do not identify galaxies at the redshift of a z$\sim$3.2 Lyman limit system (LLS) with log Z/Zsun = -3.35 +/- 0.05, placing this gas cloud in the intergalactic medium or circumgalactic medium of a galaxy below our sensitivity limits. Conversely, we detect five Ly{\alpha} emitters at the redshift of a pristine z$\sim$3.1 LLS with log Z/Zsun < -3.8, while $\sim$0.4 sources were expected given the z$\sim$3 Ly{\alpha} luminosity function. Both this high detection rate and the fact that at least three emitters appear aligned in projection with the LLS suggest that this pristine cloud is tracing a gas filament that is feeding one or multiple galaxies. Our observations uncover two different environments for metal-poor LLSs, implying a complex link between these absorbers and galaxy halos, which ongoing MUSE surveys will soon explore in detail. Moreover, in agreement with recent MUSE observations, we detected a $\sim$90 kpc Ly{\alpha} nebula at the quasar redshift and three Ly{\alpha} emitters reminiscent of a "dark galaxy" population.},

To date, however, heavy elements have been observed in all astrophysical environments. We report the detection of two gas clouds with no discernible elements heavier than hydrogen. These systems exhibit the lowest heavy-element abundance in the early universe and thus are potential fuel for the most metal poor halo stars. The detection of deuterium in one system at the level predicted by primordial nucleosynthesis provides a direct confirmation of the standard cosmological model. The composition of these clouds further implies that the transport of heavy elements from galaxies to their surroundings is highly inhomogeneous.},

abstract = {We present the results of a blind survey of Lyman limit systems (LLSs) detected in absorption against 105 quasars at z $\sim$ 3 using the blue sensitive MagE spectrograph at the Magellan Clay telescope. By searching for Lyman limit absorption in the wavelength range $\lambda$ $\sim$ 3000-4000 {\AA}, we measure the number of LLSs per unit redshift l(z) = 1.21 ± 0.28 at z $\sim$ 2.8. Using a stacking analysis, we further estimate the mean free path of ionizing photons in the z $\sim$ 3 universe \lambda ^{912}_mfp = 100 +/- 29 \ h_{70.4}^{-1}\ Mpc. Combined with our LLS survey, we conclude that systems with log N H I >= 17.5 cm-2 contribute only $\sim$40% to the observed mean free path at these redshifts. Furthermore, with the aid of photoionization modeling, we infer that a population of ionized and metal poor systems is likely required to reproduce the metal line strengths observed in a composite spectrum of 20 LLSs with log N H I $\sim$ 17.5-19 cm-2 at z $\sim$ 2.6-3.0. Finally, with a simple toy model, we deduce that gas in the halos of galaxies can alone account for the totality of LLSs at z <$\sim$ 3, but a progressively higher contribution from the intergalactic medium is required beyond z $\sim$ 3.5. We also show how the weakly evolving number of LLSs per unit redshift at z <$\sim$ 3 can be modeled either by requiring that the spatial extent of the circumgalactic medium is redshift invariant in the last $\sim$10 Gyr of cosmic evolution or by postulating that LLSs arise in halos that are rare fluctuations in the density field at each redshift.},

abstract = {We study the physical properties of a homogeneous sample of 157 optically-thick absorption line systems at redshifts $\sim$1.8-4.4, selected from a high-dispersion spectroscopic survey of Lyman limit systems (LLSs). By means of multiple ionisation models and Bayesian techniques, we derive the posterior probability distribution functions for the density, metallicity, temperature, and dust content of the absorbing gas. We find that z>2 LLSs are highly ionised with ionisation parameters between -3<log U<-2, depending on the HI column density. LLSs are characterised by low temperatures (T<5x10^4 K) and reside in dust-poor environments. Between z$\sim$2.5-3.5, $\sim$80% of the LLSs have physical densities between n(H)$\sim$10^-3.5-10^-2 cm^-3 for the assumed UV background, but we caution that a degeneracy between the ionisation parameter and the intensity of the radiation field prevents robust inference on the density and sizes of LLSs. Conversely, metallicity estimates are less sensitive to the assumptions behind ionisation corrections. LLSs at z>2 are characterised by a broad unimodal distribution over >4 orders of magnitude, with a peak at log Z/Zsun$\sim$-2. LLSs are metal poor, significantly less enriched than DLAs, with $\sim$70% of the metallicity PDF below log Z/Zsun<-1.5. The median metallicity of super LLSs with log N(HI)>19 rapidly evolves with redshift, with a ten-fold increase between z$\sim$2.1-3.6 ($\sim$1.5 Gyr). Based on this sample, we find that LLSs at z=2.5-3.5 account for $\sim$15% of all the metals produced by UV-selected galaxies. The implications for theories of cold gas accretion and metal ejection from galaxies are also discussed.},

abstract = {Hydro-cosmological simulations reveal that massive galaxies at high redshift are fed by long narrow streams of merging galaxies and a smoother component of cold gas. We post-process seven high-resolution simulated galaxies with radiative transfer to study the absorption characteristics of the gas in galaxies and streams, in comparison with the statistics of observed absorption-line systems. We find that much of the stream gas is ionized by UV radiation from background and local stellar sources, but still optically thick (? cm-2) so that the streams appear as Lyman-limit systems (LLSs). At z > 3, the fraction of neutral gas in streams becomes non-negligible, giving rise to damped Lyman $\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs) as well. The gas in the central and incoming galaxies remains mostly neutral, responsible for DLAs. Within one (two) virial radii, the covering factor of optically thick gas is <25 per cent (10 per cent) for LLSs and <5 per cent (1 per cent) for DLAs, slowly declining with time following the universal expansion. Nevertheless, galaxies and their cold streams in the studied mass range, Mvir= 1010-1012 M&sun;, account for >30 per cent of the observed absorbers in the foreground of quasars, the rest possibly arising from smaller galaxies or the intergalactic medium. The mean metallicity in the streams is ˜1 per cent solar, much lower than in the galaxies. The simulated galaxies reproduce the Ly$\alpha$-absorption equivalent widths observed around Lyman-break galaxies, but they severely underpredict the equivalent widths in metal lines, suggesting that the latter may arise from outflows. We conclude that the observed metal-poor LLSs are likely detections of the predicted cold streams. Revised analysis of the observed LLSs kinematics and simulations with more massive outflows in conjunction with the inflows may enable a clearer distinction between the signatures of the various gas modes.},

The host is a starburst galaxy with no evidence for dust and with strong Ly-alpha emission. The afterglow was located very close ($\sim$100 pc) to the center of the host suggesting that the progenitor was associated with a circumnuclear starburst.},

abstract = {Context. Gamma-ray burst (GRBs) afterglows probe sightlines to star-forming regions in distant star-forming galaxies. Here we present a study of the peculiar afterglow spectrum of the z = 0.889 Swift GRB 140506A. Aims. Our aim is to understand the origin of the very unusual properties of the absorption along the line-of-sight. Methods. We analyse spectroscopic observations obtained with the X-shooter spectrograph mounted on the ESO/VLT at two epochs 8.8 h and 33 h after the burst as well as imaging from the GROND instrument. We also present imaging and spectroscopy of the host galaxy obtained with the Magellan telescope. Results. The underlying afterglow appears to be a typical afterglow of a long-duration GRB. However, the material along the line-of- sight has imprinted very unusual features on the spectrum. Firstly, there is a very broad and strong flux drop below 8000 AA (4000 AA in the rest frame), which seems to be variable between the two spectroscopic epochs. We can reproduce the flux-drops both as a giant 2175 AA extinction bump and as an effect of multiple scattering on dust grains in a dense environment. Secondly, we detect absorption lines from excited H i and He i. We also detect molecular absorption from CH+ . Conclusions. We interpret the unusual properties of these spectra as reflecting the presence of three distinct regions along the line-of-sight: the excited He i absorption originates from an H ii-region, whereas the Balmer absorption must originate from an associated photodissociation region. The strong metal line and molecular absorption and the dust extinction must originate from a third, cooler region along the line-of-sight. The presence of (at least) three separate regions is reflected in the fact that the different absorption components have different velocities relative to the systemic redshift of the host galaxy.},

abstract = {Aims. We present early optical spectroscopy of the afterglow of the gamma-ray burst GRB 060206 with the aim of determining the metallicity of the GRB absorber and the physical conditions in the circumburst medium. We also discuss how GRBs may be important complementary probes of cosmic chemical evolution. Methods. Absorption line study of the GRB afterglow spectrum. Results. We determine the redshift of the GRB to be z = 4.04795 ± 0.00020. Based on the measurement of the neutral hydrogen column density from the damped Lyman-$\alpha$ line and the metal content from weak, unsaturated S II lines we derive a metallicity of [S/H] = -0.84 ± 0.10. This is one of the highest metallicities measured from absorption lines at z ∼ 4. From the very high column densities for the forbidden Si II*, 01*, and 01** lines we infer very high densities and low temperatures in the system. There is evidence for the presence of H2 molecules with log N(H2) ∼- 17.0, translating into a molecular fraction of log f ≈ -3.5 with f = 2N(H2)/(2W(H2) + N(HI)). Even if GRBs are only formed by single massive stars with metallicities below ∼0.3 Z⊙, they could still be fairly unbiased tracers of the bulk of the star formation at z > 2. Hence, metallicities as derived for GRB 060206 here for a complete sample of GRB afterglows will directly show the distribution of metallicities for representative star-forming galaxies at these redshifts. {\textcopyright} ESO 2006.},

abstract = {The quasar Q0918+1636 (z = 3.07) has two intervening high-metallicity Damped Lyman $\alpha$ Absorbers (DLAs) along the line of sight, at redshifts of z = 2.412 and 2.583. The z = 2.583 DLA is located at a large impact parameter of 16.2 kpc, and despite this large impact parameter it has a very high metallicity (consistent with solar), a substantial fraction of H<SUB>2</SUB> molecules and it is dusty as inferred from the reddened spectrum of the background QSO. The z = 2.412 DLA has a metallicity of [M/H] = -0.6 (based on Zn II and Si II). In this paper we present new observations of this interesting sightline consisting of deep multiband imaging and further VLT spectroscopy. By fitting stellar population synthesis models to the photometric Spectral Energy Distribution we constrain the physical properties of the z = 2.583 DLA galaxy, and we infer its morphology by fitting a S{\'{e}}rsic model to its surface brightness profile. We find it to be a relatively massive (M<SUB>⋆</SUB> ≈ 10<SUP>10</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), strongly star-forming (SFR ≈ 30 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>), dusty (E(B - V) = 0.4) galaxy with a disc-like morphology. We detect strong emission lines from the z = 2.583 DLA ([O II] $\lambda$3727, [O III] $\lambda$$\lambda$4960, 5007, H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$, albeit at low signal-to-noise ratio except for the [O III] $\lambda$5007 line). The metallicity derived from the emission lines is consistent with the absorption metallicity (12 + log (O/H) = 8.8 ± 0.2). We also detect [O III] $\lambda$5007 emission from the galaxy counterpart of the z = 2.412 DLA at a small impact parameter (<2 kpc). Overall our findings are consistent with the emerging picture that high-metallicity DLAs are associated with relatively luminous and massive galaxy counterparts, compared to typical DLAs.},

abstract = {We present the results of a search for red QSOs using a selection based on optical imaging from SDSS and near-infrared imaging from UKIDSS. For a sample of 58 candidates 46 (79%) are confirmed to be QSOs. The QSOs are predominantly dust-reddened except a handul at redshifts z>3.5. The dust is most likely located in the QSO host galaxies. 4 (7%) of the candidates turned out to be late-type stars, and another 4 (7%) are compact galaxies. The remaining 4 objects we could not identify. In terms of their optical spectra the QSOs are similar to the QSOs selected in the FIRST-2MASS red Quasar survey except they are on average fainter, more distant and only two are detected in the FIRST survey. We estimate the amount of extinction using the SDSS QSO template reddened by SMC-like dust. It is possible to get a good match to the observed (restframe ultraviolet) spectra, but for nearly all the reddened QSOs it is not possible to match the near-IR photometry from UKIDSS. The likely reasons are that the SDSS QSO template is too red at optical wavelengths due to contaminating host galaxy light and that the assumed SMC extinction curve is too shallow. Our survey has demonstrated that selection of QSOs based on near-IR photometry is an efficent way to select QSOs, including reddened QSOs, with only small contamination from late-type stars and compact galaxies. This will be useful with ongoing and future wide-field near-IR surveys such as the VISTA and EUCLID surveys. [Abridged]},

abstract = {[Abridged]. Here, we report on the discovery of the galaxy counterpart of the z_abs=2.58 DLA on the line-of-sight to the z=3.07 quasar SDSS J091826.16+163609.0. The galaxy counterpart of the DLA is detected in the OIII 5007 and OII 3726,3729 emission lines redshifted into the NIR at an impact parameter of 16 kpc. Ly-alpha emission is not detected. The upper limit implies that Ly-alpha emission from this galaxy is suppressed by more than an order of magnitude. The DLA is amongst the most metal-rich DLAs studied so far at comparable redshifts. We find evidence for substantial depletion of refractory elements onto dust grains. Fitting the main metal line component of the DLA, which is located at z_abs=2.5832 and accounts for at least 85% of the total column density of low-ionisation species, we measure metal abundances from ZnII, SII, SiII, CrII, MnII, FeII and NiII of -0.12, -0.26, -0.46, -0.88, -0.92, -1.03 and -0.78, respectively. In addition, we detect absorption in the Lyman and Werner bands of hydrogen, which represents the first detection of H_2 molecules with X-shooter. The background quasar Q0918+1636 is amongst the reddest QSOs at redshifts 3.02<z<3.12 from the SDSS catalogue. Its UV to NIR spectrum is well fitted by a composite QSO spectrum reddened by SMC/LMC-like extinction curves at z_abs=2.58 with a significant amount of extinction given by A_V = 0.2 mag. This supports previous claims that there may be more metal-rich DLAs missing from current samples due to dust reddening of the background QSOs. The fact that there is evidence for dust both in the central emitting regions of the galaxy (as evidenced by the lack of Ly-alpha emission) and at an impact parameter of 16 kpc (as probed by the DLA) suggests that dust is widespread in this system.},

abstract = {[Abridged]. Here, we report on the discovery of the galaxy counterpart of the z_abs=2.58 DLA on the line-of-sight to the z=3.07 quasar SDSS J091826.16+163609.0. The galaxy counterpart of the DLA is detected in the OIII 5007 and OII 3726,3729 emission lines redshifted into the NIR at an impact parameter of 16 kpc. Ly-alpha emission is not detected. The upper limit implies that Ly-alpha emission from this galaxy is suppressed by more than an order of magnitude. The DLA is amongst the most metal-rich DLAs studied so far at comparable redshifts. We find evidence for substantial depletion of refractory elements onto dust grains. Fitting the main metal line component of the DLA, which is located at z_abs=2.5832 and accounts for at least 85% of the total column density of low-ionisation species, we measure metal abundances from ZnII, SII, SiII, CrII, MnII, FeII and NiII of -0.12, -0.26, -0.46, -0.88, -0.92, -1.03 and -0.78, respectively. In addition, we detect absorption in the Lyman and Werner bands of hydrogen, which represents the first detection of H_2 molecules with X-shooter. The background quasar Q0918+1636 is amongst the reddest QSOs at redshifts 3.02<z<3.12 from the SDSS catalogue. Its UV to NIR spectrum is well fitted by a composite QSO spectrum reddened by SMC/LMC-like extinction curves at z_abs=2.58 with a significant amount of extinction given by A_V = 0.2 mag. This supports previous claims that there may be more metal-rich DLAs missing from current samples due to dust reddening of the background QSOs. The fact that there is evidence for dust both in the central emitting regions of the galaxy (as evidenced by the lack of Ly-alpha emission) and at an impact parameter of 16 kpc (as probed by the DLA) suggests that dust is widespread in this system.},

abstract = {The number of damped Lyalpha absorbers (DLAs) currently known is about 100, but our knowledge of their sizes and morphologies is still very sparse, as very few have been detected in emission. Here we present narrow-band and broad-band observations of a DLA in the field of the quasar pair Q0151+048A (qA) and Q0151+048B (qB). These two quasars have very similar redshifts, z_em=1.922 and 1.937 respectively, and an angular separation of 3.27 arcsec. The spectrum of qA contains a DLA at z_abs = 1.9342 (close to the emission redshift) which shows an emission line in the trough, detected at 4sigma. Our narrow-band image confirms this detection, and we find Lyalpha emission from an extended area covering 6 x 3 arcsec^2, corresponding to 25 x 12 h^-2 kpc^2 (q_0=0.5, H_0 = 100 h km s^-1). The total Lyalpha luminosity from the DLA is 1.2 x 10^43 h^-2 erg s^-1, which is several times higher than the Lyalpha luminosity found from other DLAs. The narrow-band image also indicates that qB is not covered by the DLA. This fact, together with the large equivalent width of the emission line from the Lyalpha cloud, the large luminosity, and the $\sim$ 300 km s^-1 blueshift relative to the DLA, can plausibly be explained if qB is the source of ionizing photons, lying to the near side of the DLA at a distance from the DLA of <20 h^-1 kpc. In this case the size of the emission-line region corresponds to the area over which the cloud is optically thick, i.e., is indicative of the size of a Lyman-limit system. We also consider the relation between DLAs and Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs). If DLAs are gaseous discs surrounding LBGs, and if the apparent brightnesses and impact parameters of the few identified DLAs are representative of the brighter members of the population, then the luminosity distribution of DLAs is nearly flat, and we would expect that some 70 per cent of the galaxy counterparts to DLAs at z $\sim$ 3 are fainter than m_R=28.},

abstract = { We test the hypothesis that the host galaxies of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) as well as quasar-selected damped Lyman-$\alpha$ (DLA) systems are drawn from the population of UV-selected star-forming, high z galaxies (generally referred to as Lyman-break galaxies). Specifically, we compare the metallicity distributions of the GRB and DLA populations against simple disk models where these galaxies are drawn randomly from the distribution of star-forming galaxies according to their star-formation rate and HI cross-section respectively. We find that it is possible to match both observational distributions assuming very simple and constrained relations between luminosity, metallicity, metallicity gradients and HI sizes. The simple model can be tested by observing the luminosity distribution of GRB host galaxies and by measuring the luminosity and impact parameters of DLA selected galaxies as a function of metallicity. Our results support the expectation that GRB and DLA samples, in contrast with magnitude limited surveys, provide an almost complete census of star-forming galaxies at z ≈ 3. },

abstract = {Supernovae (SNe), the luminous explosions of stars, were observed since antiquity, with typical peak luminosity not exceeding 1.2x10^{43} erg/s (absolute magnitude >-19.5 mag). It is only in the last dozen years that numerous examples of SNe that are substantially super-luminous (>7x10^{43} erg/s; <-21 mag absolute) were well-documented. Reviewing the accumulated evidence, we define three broad classes of super-luminous SN events (SLSNe). Hydrogen-rich events (SLSN-II) radiate photons diffusing out from thick hydrogen layers where they have been deposited by strong shocks, and often show signs of interaction with circumstellar material. SLSN-R, a rare class of hydrogen-poor events, are powered by very large amounts of radioactive 56Ni and arguably result from explosions of very massive stars due to the pair instability. A third, distinct group of hydrogen-poor events emits photons from rapidly-expanding hydrogen-poor material distributed over large radii, and are not powered by radioactivity (SLSN-I). These may be the hydrogen-poor analogs of SLSN-II.},

abstract = {Stars with initial masses 10 M_{solar} < M_{initial} < 100 M_{solar} fuse progressively heavier elements in their centres, up to inert iron. The core then gravitationally collapses to a neutron star or a black hole, leading to an explosion -- an iron-core-collapse supernova (SN). In contrast, extremely massive stars (M_{initial} > 140 M_{solar}), if such exist, have oxygen cores which exceed M_{core} = 50 M_{solar}. There, high temperatures are reached at relatively low densities. Conversion of energetic, pressure-supporting photons into electron-positron pairs occurs prior to oxygen ignition, and leads to a violent contraction that triggers a catastrophic nuclear explosion. Tremendous energies (>$\sim$ 10^{52} erg) are released, completely unbinding the star in a pair-instability SN (PISN), with no compact remnant. Transitional objects with 100 M_{solar} < M_{initial} < 140 M_{solar}, which end up as iron-core-collapse supernovae following violent mass ejections, perhaps due to short instances of the pair instability, may have been identified. However, genuine PISNe, perhaps common in the early Universe, have not been observed to date. Here, we present our discovery of SN 2007bi, a luminous, slowly evolving supernova located within a dwarf galaxy ($\sim$1% the size of the Milky Way). We measure the exploding core mass to be likely $\sim$100 M_{solar}, in which case theory unambiguously predicts a PISN outcome. We show that >3 M_{solar} of radioactive 56Ni were synthesized, and that our observations are well fit by PISN models. A PISN explosion in the local Universe indicates that nearby dwarf galaxies probably host extremely massive stars, above the apparent Galactic limit, perhaps resulting from star formation processes similar to those that created the first stars in the Universe.},

abstract = {The discovery of afterglows associated with $\gamma$-ray bursts at X-ray, optical and radio wavelengths and the measurement of the redshifts of some of these events has established that $\gamma$-ray bursts lie at extreme distances, making them the most powerful photon-emitters known in the Universe. Here we report the discovery of transient optical emission in the error box of the $\gamma$-ray burst GRB980425, the light curve of which was very different from that of previous optical afterglows associated with $\gamma$-ray bursts. The optical transient is located in a spiral arm of the galaxy ESO184-G82, which has a redshift velocity of only 2,550km s -1 (ref. 6). Its optical spectrum and location indicate that it is a very luminous supernova, which has been identified as SN1998bw. If this supernova and GRB980425 are indeed associated, the energy radiated in $\gamma$-rays is at least four orders of magnitude less than in other $\gamma$-ray bursts, although its appearance was otherwise unremarkable: this indicates that very different mechanisms can give rise to $\gamma$-ray bursts. But independent of this association, the supernova is itself unusual, exhibiting an unusual light curve at radio wavelengths that requires that the gas emitting the radio photons be expanding relativistically.},

abstract = {We use optical integral field spectroscopy (IFS) of nearby supernova (SN) host galaxies (0.005 < z < 0.03) provided by the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA) Survey with the goal of finding correlations in the environmental parameters at the location of different SN types. In this first study of a series we focus on the properties related with star formation (SF). We recover the sequence in association of different SN types to the star-forming regions by using several indicators of the ongoing and recent SF related to both the ionized gas and the stellar populations. While the total ongoing SF is on average the same for the three SN types, SNe Ibc/IIb tend to occur closer to star-forming regions and in higher SF density locations than SNe II and SNe Ia; the latter shows the weakest correlation. SNe Ia host galaxies have masses that are on average ∼0.3−0.8 dex higher than those of the core collapse (CC) SNe hosts because the SNe Ia hosts contain a larger fraction of old stellar populations. Using the recent SN Ia delay-time distribution and the SFHs of the galaxies, we show that the SN Ia hosts in our sample are expected to produce twice as many SNe Ia as the CC SN hosts. Since both types occur in hosts with a similar SF rate and hence similar CC SN rate, this can explain the mass difference between the SN Ia and CC SN hosts, and reinforces the finding that at least part of the SNe Ia originate from very old progenitors. By comparing the mean SFH of the eight least massive galaxies with that of the massive SF SN Ia hosts, we find that the low-mass galaxies formed their stars during a longer time (0.65%, 24.46%, and 74.89% in the intervals 0-0.42 Gyr, 0.42-2.4 Gyr, and >2.4 Gyr, respectively) than the massive SN Ia hosts (0.04%, 2.01%, and 97.95% in these intervals). We estimate that the low-mass galaxies produce ten times fewer SNe Ia and three times fewer CC SNe than the high-mass group. Therefore the ratio between the number of CC SNe and SNe Ia is expected to increase with decreasing galaxy mass. CC SNe tend to explode at positions with younger stellar populations than the galaxy average, but the galaxy properties at SNe Ia locations are one average the same as the global galaxy properties.},

PISCO is the largest collection of SN host galaxies observed with wide-field IFS, totaling 466,347 individual spectra covering a typical spatial resolution of $\sim$380 pc. While focused studies regarding specific SN Ia- related topics will be published elsewhere, this paper aims to present the properties of the SN environments with stellar population (SP) synthesis and the gas-phase ISM, providing additional results separating stripped-envelope SNe into their subtypes. With 11,270 HII regions detected in all galaxies, we present for the first time an HII region statistical analysis, that puts HII regions that have hosted SNe in context with all other SF clumps within their galaxies. SNe Ic are associated to more metal-rich, higher EW(H{\alpha}) and higher SF rate environments within their host galaxies than the mean of all HII regions detected within each host, on contrary SNe IIb occur at the most different environments compared to other CC SNe types. We find two clear components of young and old SP at SNe IIn locations. We find that SNe II fast-decliners (IIL) tend to explode at locations where {\Sigma}SFR is more intense. Finally, we outline how a future dedicated IFS survey of galaxies in parallel to an untargeted SN search would overcome the biases in current environmental studies.},

abstract = {Stellar masses play a crucial role in the exploration of galaxy properties and the evolution of the galaxy population. In this paper, we explore the minimum possible uncertainties in stellar mass-to-light ratios (M */L) from the assumed star formation history (SFH) and metallicity distribution, with the goals of providing a minimum set of requirements for observational studies. We use a large Monte Carlo library of SFHs to study as a function of galaxy spectral type and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) the statistical uncertainties of M */L values using either absorption-line data or broadband colors. The accuracy of M */L estimates can be significantly improved by using metal-sensitive indices in combination with age-sensitive indices, in particular for galaxies with intermediate-age or young stellar populations. While M */L accuracy clearly depends on the spectral S/N, there is no significant gain in improving the S/N much above 50 pixel-1 and limiting uncertainties of ∼ 0.03 dex are reached. Assuming that dust is accurately corrected or absent and that the redshift is known, color-based M */L estimates are only slightly more uncertain than spectroscopic estimates (at comparable spectroscopic and photometric quality), but are more easily affected by systematic biases. This is the case in particular for galaxies with bursty SFHs (high H$\delta$A at fixed D4000n), the M */L of which cannot be constrained any better than ∼ 0.15 dex with any indicators explored here. Finally, we explore the effects of the assumed prior distribution in SFHs and metallicity, finding them to be higher for color-based estimates. {\textcopyright} 2009.

abstract = {We derive stellar metallicities, light-weighted ages and stellar masses for a magnitude-limited sample of 175 128 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release Two (SDSS DR2). We compute the median-likelihood estimates of these parameters using a large library of model spectra at medium-high resolution, covering a comprehensive range of star formation histories. The constraints we derive are set by the simultaneous fit of five spectral absorption features, which are well reproduced by our population synthesis models. By design, these constraints depend only weakly on the $\alpha$/Fe element abundance ratio. Our sample includes galaxies of all types spanning the full range in star formation activity, from dormant early-type to actively star-forming galaxies. By analysing a subsample of 44 254 high-quality spectra, we show that, in the mean, galaxies follow a sequence of increasing stellar metallicity, age and stellar mass at increasing 4000-{\AA} break strength. For galaxies of intermediate mass, stronger Balmer absorption at fixed 4000-{\AA} break strength is associated with higher metallicity and younger age. We investigate how stellar metallicity and age depend on total galaxy stellar mass. Low-mass galaxies are typically young and metal-poor, massive galaxies old and metal-rich, with a rapid transition between these regimes over the stellar mass range 3 × 109 ≲ M * ≲ 3 × 10 10M⊙. Both high- and low-concentration galaxies follow these relations, but there is a large dispersion in stellar metallicity at fixed stellar mass, especially for low-concentration galaxies of intermediate mass. Despite the large scatter, the relation between stellar metallicity and stellar mass is similar to the correlation between gas-phase oxygen abundance and stellar mass for star-forming galaxies. This is confirmed by the good correlation between stellar metallicity and gas-phase oxygen abundance for galaxies with both measures. The substantial range in stellar metallicity at fixed gas-phase oxygen abundance suggests that gas ejection and/or accretion are important factors in galactic chemical evolution. {\textcopyright} 2005 RAS.},

It is a first-of-its-kind autonomous rapid-slewing satellite for transient astronomy and pioneers the way for future rapid-reaction and multiwavelength missions. It will be far more powerful than any previous GRB mission, observing more than 100 bursts yr {\`{A}}1 and performing detailed X-ray and UV/optical afterglow obser-vations spanning timescales from 1 minute to several days after the burst. The objectives are to (1) determine the origin of GRBs, (2) classify GRBs and search for new types, (3) study the interaction of the ultrarelativistic outflows of GRBs with their surrounding medium, and (4) use GRBs to study the early universe out to z > 10. The mission is being developed by a NASA-led international collaboration. It will carry three instruments: a new-generation wide-field gamma-ray (15–150 keV) detector that will detect bursts, calculate 1 0 –4 0 positions, and trigger autonomous spacecraft slews; a narrow-field X-ray telescope that will give 5 00 positions and perform spectroscopy in the 0.2–10 keV band; and a narrow-field UV/optical telescope that will operate in the 170– 600 nm band and provide 0B3 positions and optical finding charts. Redshift determinations will be made for most bursts. In addition to the primary GRB science, the mission will perform a hard X-ray survey to a sensitivity of $1 mcrab ($2 ; 10 {\`{A}}11 ergs cm {\`{A}}2 s {\`{A}}1 in the 15–150 keV band), more than an order of magnitude better than HEAO 1 A-4. A flexible data and operations system will allow rapid follow-up observations of all types of high-energy transients, with rapid data downlink and uplink available through the NASA TDRSS system. Swift transient data will be rapidly distributed to the astronomical community, and all interested observers are en-couraged to participate in follow-up measurements. A Guest Investigator program for the mission will provide funding for community involvement. Innovations from the Swift program applicable to the future include (1) a large-area gamma-ray detector using the new CdZnTe detectors, (2) an autonomous rapid-slewing spacecraft, (3) a multiwavelength payload combining optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray instruments, (4) an observing program co-ordinated with other ground-based and space-based observatories, and (5) immediate multiwavelength data flow to the community. The mission is currently funded for 2 yr of operations, and the spacecraft will have a lifetime to orbital decay of $8 yr.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature. All rights reserved. In the cold dark matter cosmology, the baryonic components of galaxies - stars and gas - are thought to be mixed with and embedded in non-baryonic and non-relativistic dark matter, which dominates the total mass of the galaxy and its dark-matter halo. In the local (low-redshift) Universe, the mass of dark matter within a galactic disk increases with disk radius, becoming appreciable and then dominant in the outer, baryonic regions of the disks of star-forming galaxies. This results in rotation velocities of the visible matter within the disk that are constant or increasing with disk radius - a hallmark of the dark-matter model. Comparisons between the dynamical mass, inferred from these velocities in rotational equilibrium, and the sum of the stellar and cold-gas mass at the peak epoch of galaxy formation ten billion years ago, inferred from ancillary data, suggest high baryon fractions in the inner, star-forming regions of the disks. Although this implied baryon fraction may be larger than in the local Universe, the systematic uncertainties (owing to the chosen stellar initial-mass function and the calibration of gas masses) render such comparisons inconclusive in terms of the mass of dark matter. Here we report rotation curves (showing rotation velocity as a function of disk radius) for the outer disks of six massive star-forming galaxies, and find that the rotation velocities are not constant, but decrease with radius. We propose that this trend arises because of a combination of two main factors: first, a large fraction of the massive high-redshift galaxy population was strongly baryon-dominated, with dark matter playing a smaller part than in the local Universe; and second, the large velocity dispersion in high-redshift disks introduces a substantial pressure term that leads to a decrease in rotation velocity with increasing radius. The effect of both factors appears to increase with redshift. Qualitatively, the observations suggest that baryons in the early (high-redshift) Universe efficiently condensed at the centres of dark-matter haloes when gas fractions were high and dark matter was less concentrated.},

abstract = {We use the first systematic data sets of CO molecular line emission in z$\sim$1-3 normal star forming galaxies for a comparison of the dependence of galaxy-averaged star formation rates on molecular gas masses at low and high redshifts, and in different galactic environments. Although the current high-z samples are still small and biased toward the luminous and massive tail of the actively star-forming 'main-sequence', a fairly clear picture is emerging. Independent of whether galaxy integrated quantities or surface densities are considered, low- and high-z SFG galaxy populations appear to follow similar molecular gas-star formation relations with slopes 1.1 to 1.2. The gas-depletion time scale in these SFGs grows from 0.5 Gyrs at z$\sim$2 to 1.5 Gyrs at z$\sim$0. Because star formation depletion times are significantly smaller than the Hubble time at all redshifts sampled, star formation rates and gas fractions are set by the balance between gas accretion from the halo and stellar feedback. In contrast, very luminous gas rich major mergers at both low-z and high-z produce on average 4 to10 times more far-infrared luminosity per unit gas mass. Only some fraction of this difference can be explained by uncertainties in gas-mass or luminosity estimators; much of it must be intrinsic. The most likely interpretation is that the star formation relation is driven by global dynamical effects. For a given mass, the more compact merger systems produce stars more rapidly because their gas clouds are more compressed with shorter dynamical times, so that they churn more quickly through the available gas reservoir than the typical normal disk galaxies. When the dependence on galactic dynamical time scale is explicitly included, disk galaxies and mergers appear to follow similar gas to star-formation relations. The mergers may be forming stars at slightly higher efficiencies than the disks.},

abstract = {Gamma Ray Bursts are detectable in the gamma-ray band if their jets are oriented towards the observer. However, for each GRB with a typical theta_jet, there should be $\sim$2/theta_jet^2 bursts whose emission cone is oriented elsewhere in space. These off-axis bursts can be eventually detected when, due to the deceleration of their relativistic jets, the beaming angle becomes comparable to the viewing angle. Orphan Afterglows (OA) should outnumber the current population of bursts detected in the gamma-ray band even if they have not been conclusively observed so far at any frequency. We compute the expected flux of the population of orphan afterglows in the mm, optical and X-ray bands through a population synthesis code of GRBs and the standard afterglow emission model. We estimate the detection rate of OA by on-going and forthcoming surveys. The average duration of OA as transients above a given limiting flux is derived and described with analytical expressions: in general OA should appear as daily transients in optical surveys and as monthly/yearly transients in the mm/radio band. We find that $\sim$ 2 OA yr^-1 could already be detected by Gaia and up to 20 OA yr^-1 could be observed by the ZTF survey. A larger number of 50 OA yr^-1 should be detected by LSST in the optical band. For the X-ray band, $\sim$ 26 OA yr^-1 could be detected by the eROSITA. For the large population of OA detectable by LSST, the X-ray and optical follow up of the light curve (for the brightest cases) and/or the extensive follow up of their emission in the mm and radio band could be the key to disentangle their GRB nature from other extragalactic transients of comparable flux density.},

abstract = {We present detailed spectroscopic analysis of the extraordinarily fast-evolving transient AT2018kzr. The transient's observed light curve showed a rapid decline rate, comparable to the kilonova AT2017gfo. We calculate a self-consistent sequence of radiative transfer models (using tardis) and determine that the ejecta material is dominated by intermediate-mass elements (O, Mg, and Si), with a photospheric velocity of ∼12 000–14 500 $\rm {km}\, s^{-1}$. The early spectra have the unusual combination of being blue but dominated by strong Fe ii and Fe iii absorption features. We show that this combination is only possible with a high Fe content (3.5 per cent). This implies a high Fe/(Ni+Co) ratio. Given the short time from the transient's proposed explosion epoch, the Fe cannot be 56Fe resulting from the decay of radioactive 56Ni synthesized in the explosion. Instead, we propose that this is stable 54Fe, and that the transient is unusually rich in this isotope. We further identify an additional, high-velocity component of ejecta material at ∼20 000–26 000 $\rm {km}\, s^{-1}$, which is mildly asymmetric and detectable through the Ca ii near-infrared triplet. We discuss our findings with reference to a range of plausible progenitor systems and compare with published theoretical work. We conclude that AT2018kzr is most likely the result of a merger between an ONe white dwarf and a neutron star or black hole. As such, it would be the second plausible candidate with a good spectral sequence for the electromagnetic counterpart of a compact binary merger, after AT2017gfo.},

abstract = {We report ALMA observations of the most massive (star forming) galaxy in the redshift range 3<z<4 within the whole GOODS-S field. We detect a large elongated structure of molecular gas around the massive primeval galaxy, traced by the CO(4-3) emission, and extended over 40 kpc. We infer a mass of the large gaseous structure of Mgas$\sim$2-6x10^11 Msun. About 60% of this mass is not directly associated with either the central galaxy or its two lower mass satellites. The CO extended structure is also detected in continuum thermal emission. The kinematics of the molecular gas shows the presence of different components, which cannot be ascribed to simple rotation. Furthermore, on even larger scales, we detect nine additional CO systems within a radius of 250 kpc from the massive galaxy and mostly distributed in the same direction as the CO elongated structure found in the central 40 kpc. The stacked images of these CO systems show detections in the thermal continuum and in the X-rays, suggesting that these systems are forming stars at a rate of 30-120 Msun/yr. We suggest that the extended gas structure, combined with its kinematic properties, and the gas rich star forming systems detected on larger scales, are tracing the inner and densest regions of large scale accreting streams, feeding the central massive galaxy. These results corroborate models of galaxy formation, in which accreting streams are clumpy and undergo some star formation (hence enriching the streams with metals) even before accreting onto the central galaxy.},

abstract = {We present a galactic chemical evolution model which adopts updated prescriptions for all the main processes governing the dust cycle. We follow in detail the evolution of the abundances of several chemical species (C, O, S, Si, Fe and Zn) in the gas and dust of a typical dwarf irregular galaxy. The dwarf irregular galaxy is assumed to evolve with a low but continuous level of star formation and experience galactic winds triggered by supernova explosions. We predict the evolution of the gas to dust ratio in such a galaxy and discuss critically the main processes involving dust, such as dust production by AGB stars and Type II SNe, destruction and accretion (gas condensation in clouds). We then apply our model to Damped Lyman-Alpha systems which are believed to be dwarf irregulars, as witnessed by their abundance patterns. Our main conclusions are: i) we can reproduce the observed gas to dust ratio in dwarf galaxies. ii) We find that the process of dust accretion plays a fundamental role in the evolution of dust and in certain cases it becomes the dominant process in the dust cycle. On the other hand, dust destruction seems to be a negligible process in irregulars. iii) Concerning Damped Lyman-Alpha systems, we show that the observed gas-phase abundances of silicon, normalized to volatile elements (zinc and sulfur), are in agreement with our model. iv) The abundances of iron and silicon in DLA systems suggest that the two elements undergo a different history of dust formation and evolution. Our work casts light on the nature of iron-rich dust: the observed depletion pattern of iron is well reproduced only when an additional source of iron dust is considered. Here we explore the possibility of a contribution from Type Ia SNe as well as an efficient accretion of iron nano-particles.},

abstract = {Cold gas streaming along the dark matter filaments of the cosmic web is predicted to be the major source of fuel for disc buildup, violent disc instability and star formation in massive galaxies at high redshift. We investigate to what extent such cold gas is detectable in the extended circumgalactic environment of galaxies via Ly$\alpha$ absorption and selected low-ionization metal absorption lines. We model the expected absorption signatures using high-resolution zoom-in adaptive mesh refinement cosmological simulations. In the post-processing, we distinguish between self-shielded gas and unshielded gas. In the self-shielded gas, which is optically thick to Lyman continuum radiation, we assume pure collisional ionization for species with an ionization potential greater than 13.6 eV. In the optically-thin, unshielded gas, these species are also photoionized by the metagalactic radiation. In addition to absorption of radiation from background quasars, we compute the absorption line profiles of radiation emitted by the galaxy at the centre of the same halo. We predict the strength of the absorption signal for individual galaxies without stacking. We find that the Ly$\alpha$ absorption profiles produced by the streams are consistent with observations of absorption and emission Ly$\alpha$ profiles in high-redshift galaxies. Due to the low metallicities in the streams, and their low covering factors, the metal absorption features are weak and difficult to detect.},

abstract = {We present an exhaustive quantitative comparison of all the known extinction curves in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds (SMC and LMC) with our understanding of the general behavior of Milky Way extinction curves. The RV-dependent CCM relationship of Cardelli, Clayton, and Mathis and the sample of extinction curves used to derive this relationship are used to describe the general behavior of Milky Way extinction curves. The ultraviolet portion of the SMC and LMC extinction curves are derived from archival IUE data, except for one new SMC extinction curve, which was measured using Hubble Space Telescope Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph observations. The optical extinction curves are derived from new (for the SMC) and literature UBVRI photometry (for the LMC). The near-infrared extinction curves are calculated mainly from 2MASS photometry supplemented with DENIS and new JHK photometry. For each extinction curve, we give RV = A(V)/E(B - V) and N(H I) values that probe the same dust column as the extinction curve. We compare the properties of the SMC and LMC extinction curves with the CCM relationship three different ways: each curve by itself, the behavior of extinction at different wavelengths with RV, and the behavior of the extinction curve Fitzpatrick and Massa fit parameters with RV. As has been found previously, we find that a small number of LMC extinction curves are consistent with the CCM relationship, but the majority of the LMC and all the SMC curves do not follow the CCM relationship. For the first time, we find that the CCM relationship seems to form a bound on the properties of all the LMC and SMC extinction curves. This result strengthens the picture dust extinction curves exhibit of a continuum of properties between those found in the Milky Way and the SMC bar. Tentative evidence based on the behavior of the extinction curves with dust-to-gas ratio suggests that the continuum of dust extinction curves is possibly caused by the environmental stresses of nearby star formation activity.},

abstract = {Understanding how QSO's UV radiation affects galaxy formation is vital to our understanding of reionization era. Using a custom made narrow-band filter, $NB906$, on Subaru/Suprime-Cam, we investigated the number density of Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAE) around a QSO at z=6.4. To date, this is the highest redshift narrow-band observation, where LAEs around a luminous QSO are investigated. Due to the large field-of-view of Suprime-Cam, our survey area is $\sim$5400$\sim$cMpc$^2$, much larger than previously studies at z=5.7 ($\sim$200 cMpc$^2$). In this field, we previously found a factor of 7 overdensity of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). Based on this, we expected to detect $\sim$100 LAEs down to $NB906$=25 ABmag. However, our 6.4 hour exposure found none. The obtained upper limit on the number density of LAEs is more than an order lower than the blank fields. Furthermore, this lower density of LAEs spans a large scale of 10 $p$Mpc across. A simple argument suggests a strong UV radiation from the QSO can suppress star-formation in halos with $M_{vir}<10^{10}M_{\odot}$ within a $p$Mpc from the QSO, but the deficit at the edge of the field (5 $p$Mpc) remains to be explained.},

abstract = {Recently, it has been suggested that the metallicity aversion of Long-duration Gamma Ray Bursts (LGRBs) is not intrinsic to their formation, but rather a consequence of the anti-correlation between star formation and metallicity seen in the general galaxy population. To investigate this proposal, we compare the metallicity of the hosts of LGRBs, broad-lined Type Ic (Ic-bl) supernovae (SNe), and Type II SNe to each other and to the metallicity distribution of star-forming galaxies using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to represent galaxies in the local universe and the Team Keck Redshift Survey (TKRS) for galaxies at intermediate redshifts. The differing metallicity distributions of LGRB hosts and the star formation in local galaxies forces us to conclude that the low-metallicity preference of LGRBs is not primarily driven by the anti-correlation between star formation and metallicity, but rather must be overwhelmingly due to the astrophysics of the LGRBs themselves. Three quarters of our LGRB sample are found at metallicities below 12+log(O/H) < 8.6, while less than a one-tenth of local star formation is at similarly low metallicities. However, our SN samples are statistically consistent with the metallicity distribution of the general galaxy population. Additionally, we show that the star formation rate distribution of the LGRB and SNe host populations are consistent with the star formation rate distribution of the SDSS galaxy sample. This provides further evidence that the low-metallicity distribution of LGRBs is not caused by the general properties of star-forming galaxies. Using the TKRS population of galaxies, we can exclude the possibility that the LGRB host metallicity aversion is caused by the decrease in galaxy metallicity with redshift, as this effect is clearly much smaller than the observed LGRB host metallicity bias over the redshift span of our sample. The presence of the strong metallicity difference between LGRBs and Type Ic-bl SNe largely eliminates the possibility that the observed LGRB metallicity bias is a byproduct of a difference in the initial mass functions of the galaxy populations. Rather, metallicity below half-solar must be a fundamental component of the evolutionary process that separates LGRBs from the vast majority of Type Ic-bl SNe and from the bulk of local star formation.},

abstract = {We estimate the LGRB progenitor rate using our recent work on the effects of environmental metallically on LGRB formation in concert with SNe statistics via an approach patterned loosely off the Drake equation. Beginning with the cosmic star-formation history, we consider the expected number of broad-line Type Ic events (the SNe type associated with LGRBs) that are in low metallicity host environments adjusted by the contribution of high metallicity host environments at a much reduced rate. We then compare this estimate to the observed LGRB rate corrected for instrumental selection effects to provide a combined estimate of the efficiency fraction of these progenitors to produce LGRBs and the fraction of which are beamed in our direction. From this we estimate that an aligned LGRB occurs for approximately every 4000 low metallically broad-lined Type Ic Supernovae. Therefore if one assumes a semi-nominal beaming factor of 100 then only about one such supernova out of 40 produce an LGRB. Finally we propose an off-axis LGRB search strategy of targeting for radio observation broad-line Type Ic events that occur in low metallicity hosts.},

abstract = {Deriving physical parameters from gamma-ray burst afterglow observations remains a challenge, even now, 20 years after the discovery of afterglows. The main reason for the lack of progress is that the peak of the synchrotron emission is in the sub-mm range, thus requiring radio observations in conjunction with X-ray/optical/near-infrared data in order to measure the corresponding spectral slopes and consequently remove the ambiguity wrt. slow vs. fast cooling and the ordering of the characteristic frequencies. We observed GRB 151027B, the 1000th Swift-detected GRB, with GROND in the optical-NIR, ALMA in the sub-millimeter, ATCA in the radio band, and combine this with public Swift-XRT X-ray data. While some observations at crucial times only return upper limits or surprising features, the fireball model is narrowly constrained by our data set, and allows us to draw a consistent picture with a fully-determined parameter set. Surprisingly, we find rapid, large-amplitude flux density variations in the radio band which are extreme not only for GRBs, but generally for any radio source. We interpret these as scintillation effects, though the extreme nature requires either the scattering screen to be at much smaller distance than usually assumed, multiple screens, or a combination of the two.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved. We present the first uniform treatment of long duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxy detections and upper limits over the redshift range 3 ≤ z ≤ 5, a key epoch for observational and theoretical efforts to understand the processes, environments, and consequences of early cosmic star formation (SF). We contribute deep imaging observations of 13 GRB positions yielding the discovery of 8 new host galaxies. We use this data set in tandem with previously published observations of 31 further GRB positions to estimate or constrain the host galaxy restframe ultraviolet (UV; l = 1600) absolute magnitudes MUV. We then use the combined set of 44 MUV estimates and limits to construct the MUV luminosity function (LF) for GRB host galaxies over 3 ≤ z ≤ 5 and compare it to expectations from Lyman break galaxy (LBG) photometric surveys with the Hubble Space Telescope. Adopting standard prescriptions for the luminosity dependence of galaxy dust obscuration (and hence, total SF rate), we find that our LF is compatible with LBG observations over a factor of 600 in host luminosity, from MUV = -22.5 mag to -15.6 mag, and with extrapolations of the assumed Schechter-type LF well beyond this range. We review proposed astrophysical and observational biases for our sample, and find that they are for the most part minimal. We therefore conclude, as the simplest interpretation of our results, that GRBs successfully trace UV metrics of cosmic SF over the range 3 ≤ z ≤ 5. Our findings suggest that GRBs provide an accurate picture of star formation processes from z 3 out to the highest redshifts.},

Spectroscopy obtained at the ESO-VLT revealed a continuum extending down to $\lambda$ = 9400 {\AA}, and zero flux for 7500 {\AA}<$\lambda$ < =9400 {\AA}, which we interpret as the onset of a Gunn-Peterson trough at z = 6.695± 0.025 (95.5% confidence level), making GRB 080913 the highest-redshift gamma-ray burst (GRB) to date, and more distant than the highest-redshift QSO.

abstract = {A new class of ultra-long-duration (more than 10,000 seconds) $\gamma$-ray bursts has recently been suggested. They may originate in the explosion of stars with much larger radii than those producing normal long-duration $\gamma$-ray bursts or in the tidal disruption of a star. No clear supernova has yet been associated with an ultra-long-duration $\gamma$-ray burst. Here we report that a supernova (SN 2011kl) was associated with the ultra-long-duration $\gamma$-ray burst GRB 111209A, at a redshift z of 0.677. This supernova is more than three times more luminous than type Ic supernovae associated with long-duration $\gamma$-ray bursts, and its spectrum is distinctly different. The slope of the continuum resembles those of super-luminous supernovae, but extends further down into the rest-frame ultraviolet implying a low metal content. The light curve evolves much more rapidly than those of super-luminous supernovae. This combination of high luminosity and low metal-line opacity cannot be reconciled with typical type Ic supernovae, but can be reproduced by a model where extra energy is injected by a strongly magnetized neutron star (a magnetar), which has also been proposed as the explanation for super-luminous supernovae.},

abstract = {We have analyzed FUSE (905-1187 {\AA}) spectra of a sample of 16 local starburst galaxies. These galaxies cover almost three orders of magnitude in star-formation rates and over two orders of magnitude in stellar mass. Absorption features from the stars and interstellar medium are observed in all the spectra. The strongest interstellar absorption features are generally blue-shifted by $\sim$ 50-300 km s-1, implying the almost ubiquitous presence of starburst-driven galactic winds in this sample. The outflow velocites increase with both the star-formation rate and the star-formation rate per unit stellar mass, consistent with a galactic wind, driven by the population of massive stars. We find outflowing coronal-phase gas (T $\sim$105.5 K) detected via the O VI absorption line in nearly every galaxy. The O VI absorption-line profile is optically thin, is generally weak near the galaxy-systemic velocity, and has a higher mean outflow velocity than seen in the lower ionization lines. The relationship between the line width and column density for the O VI absorbing gas is in good agreement with expectations for radiatively cooling and outflowing gas. Such gas will be created in the interaction of the hot out-rushing wind seen in X-ray emission and cool dense ambient material. O VI emission is not generally detected in our sample, suggesting that radiative cooling by the coronal gas is not dynamically significant in draining energy from galactic winds. We find that the measured outflow velocities in the H I and H II phases of the interstellar gas in a given galaxy increase with the strength (equivalent width) of the absorption feature and not with the ionization potential of the species. The strong lines often have profiles consisting of a broad and optically-thick component centered near the galaxy-systemic velocity and weaker but highly blue-shifted absorption. This suggests that the outflowing gas with high velocity has a lower column density than the more quiescent gas, and can only be readily detected in the strongest absorption lines. From direct observations below the Lyman edge in the galaxy rest frame, we find no evidence of Lyman continuum radiation escaping from any of the galaxies in the sample. Moreover, the small escape fraction of light in the center of the strong C II absorption feature confirms the high opacity below the Lyman limit in the neutral ISM. The absolute fraction of escaping Lyman continuum photons is typically <1%. This sample provides a unique window on the global properties of local star-forming galaxies as observed in the far-UV and also provides a useful comparison sample for understanding spectra of high-redshift star-forming galaxies.},

abstract = {We implement an algorithm for detecting and removing artifacts from astronomical images by means of outlier rejection during stacking. Our method is capable of addressing both small, highly significant artifacts such as cosmic rays and, by applying a filtering technique to generate single frame masks, larger area but lower surface brightness features such as secondary (ghost) images of bright stars. In contrast to the common method of building a median stack, the clipped or outlier-filtered mean stacked point-spread function (PSF) is a linear combination of the single frame PSFs as long as the latter are moderately homogeneous, a property of great importance for weak lensing shape measurement or model fitting photometry. In addition, it has superior noise properties, allowing a significant reduction in exposure time compared to median stacking. We make publicly available a modified version of SWarp that implements clipped mean stacking and software to generate single frame masks from the list of outlier pixels.},

abstract = {We present the weak lensing analysis of the Wide-Field Imager Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Cluster of Galaxy (WISCy) sample, a set of 12 clusters of galaxies selected for their Sunyaev- Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. After developing new and improved methods for background selection and determination of geometric lensing scaling factors from absolute multiband photometry in cluster fields, we compare the weak lensing mass estimate with public X-ray and SZ data. We find consistency with hydrostatic X-ray masses with no significant bias, no mass dependent bias and less than 20 per cent intrinsic scatter and constrain fgas,500c = 0.128+0.029-0.023. We independently calibrate the South Pole Telescope significance-mass relation and find consistency with previous results. The comparison of weak lensing mass and Planck Compton parameters, whether extracted self-consistently with a mass-observable relation (MOR) or using X-ray prior information on cluster size, shows significant discrepancies. The deviations from the MOR strongly correlate with clustermass and redshift. This could be explained either by a significantly shallower than expected slope of Compton decrement versus mass and a corresponding problem in the previous X-ray based mass calibration, or a size or redshift dependent bias in SZ signal extraction. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.

The S1 region, covering about 4 deg2, has also been surveyed in the mid- and far-infrared (5-200 $\mu$m) with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO). The radio survey provides uniform coverage of the entire S1 region, with a sensitivity (5$\sigma$) of 0.4 mJy over the whole area and 0.2 mJy in the centre. To this sensitivity, virtually all the radio counterparts of the far-infrared extragalactic ISO sources should be detected. This paper presents a radio sample - complete at the 5$\sigma$ level - consisting of 581 sources detected at 1.4 GHz. Of these radio sources, 349 have peak flux density in the range 0.2-1 mJy, forming a new homogeneous sample of sub-mJy radio sources. Due to its size, depth and multiwaveband coverage, the sample will allow us to study in greater detail the sub-mJy radio source population.

abstract = {Host galaxy identification is a crucial step for modern supernova (SN) surveys such as the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), which will discover SNe by the thousands. Spectroscopic resources are limited, so in the absence of real-time SN spectra these surveys must rely on host galaxy spectra to obtain accurate redshifts for the Hubble diagram and to improve photometric classification of SNe. In addition, SN luminosities are known to correlate with host-galaxy properties. Therefore, reliable identification of host galaxies is essential for cosmology and SN science. We simulate SN events and their locations within their host galaxies to develop and test methods for matching SNe to their hosts. We use both real and simulated galaxy catalog data from the Advanced Camera for Surveys General Catalog and MICECATv2.0, respectively. We also incorporate "hostless" SNe residing in undetected faint hosts into our analysis, with an assumed hostless rate of 5%. Our fully automated algorithm is run on catalog data and matches SNe to their hosts with 91% accuracy. We find that including a machine learning component, run after the initial matching algorithm, improves the accuracy (purity) of the matching to 97% with a 2% cost in efficiency (true positive rate). Although the exact results are dependent on the details of the survey and the galaxy catalogs used, the method of identifying host galaxies we outline here can be applied to any transient survey.},

abstract = {The reionisation of the Universe is thought to have ended around z$\sim$6, as inferred from spectroscopy of distant bright background sources, such as quasars (QSO) and gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows. Furthermore, spectroscopy of a GRB afterglow provides insight in its host galaxy, which is often too dim and distant to study otherwise. We present the high S/N VLT/X-shooter spectrum of GRB130606A at z=5.913. We aim to measure the degree of ionisation of the IGM between 5.02<z<5.84 and to study the chemical abundance pattern and dust content of its host galaxy. We measured the flux decrement due to absorption at Ly$\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ wavelength regions. The hydrogen and metal absorption lines formed in the host galaxy were fitted with Voigt profiles to obtain column densities. Our measurements of the Ly$\alpha$-forest optical depth are consistent with previous measurements of QSOs, but have a much smaller uncertainty. The analysis of the red damping wing yields a neutral fraction $x_{HI}<0.05$ (3$\sigma$). We obtain column density measurements of several elements. The ionisation corrections due to the GRB is estimated to be negligible (<0.03 dex), but larger corrections may apply due to the pre-existing radiation field (up to 0.4 dex based on sub-DLA studies). Our measurements confirm that the Universe is already predominantly ionised over the redshift range probed in this work, but was slightly more neutral at z>5.6. GRBs are useful probes of the ionisation state of the IGM in the early Universe, but because of internal scatter we need a larger statistical sample to draw robust conclusions. The high [Si/Fe] in the host can be due to dust depletion, alpha-element enhancement, or a combination of both. The very high value of [Al/Fe]=2.40+/-0.78 might connected to the stellar population history. We estimate the host metallicity to be -1.7<[M/H]<-0.9 (2%-13% of solar). (trunc.)},

abstract = {Using ultra-violet absorption-lines, we analyze the systematic properties of the warm ionized phase of starburst-driven winds in a sample of 39 low-redshift objects that spans broad ranges in starburst and galaxy properties. Total column densities for the outflows are $\sim$10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. The outflow velocity (v$_{out}$) correlates only weakly with the galaxy stellar mass (M$_*$), or circular velocity (v$_{cir}$), but strongly with both SFR and SFR/area. The normalized outflow velocity (v$_{out}/v_{cir}$) correlates well with both SFR/area and SFR/M$_*$. The estimated outflow rates of warm ionized gas ($\dot{M}$) are $\sim$ 1 to 4 times the SFR, and the ratio $\dot{M}/SFR$ does not correlate with v$_{out}$. We show that a model of a population of clouds accelerated by the combined forces of gravity and the momentum flux from the starburst matches the data. We find a threshold value for the ratio of the momentum flux supplied by the starburst to the critical momentum flux needed for the wind to overcome gravity acting on the clouds ($R_{crit}$). For $R_{crit} >$ 10 (strong-outflows) the outflow momentum flux is similar to the total momentum flux from the starburst and the outflow velocity exceeds the galaxy escape velocity. Neither is the case for the weak-outflows ($R_{crit} <$ 10). For the weak-outflows, the data severely disagree with many prescriptions in numerical simulations or semi-analytic models of galaxy evolution. The agreement is better for the strong-outflows, and we advocate the use of $R_{crit}$ to guide future prescriptions.},

abstract = {We here present the spectroscopic follow-up observations with VLT/X-shooter of the Swift long-duration gamma-ray burst GRB 160804A at z = 0.737. Typically, GRBs are found in low-mass, metal-poor galaxies which constitute the sub-luminous population of star-forming galaxies. For the host galaxy of the GRB presented here we derive a stellar mass of $\log(M_*/M_{\odot}) = 9.80\pm 0.07$, a roughly solar metallicity (12+log(O/H) = $8.74\pm 0.12$) based on emission line diagnostics, and an infrared luminosity of $M_{3.6/(1+z)} = -21.94$ mag, but find it to be dust-poor ($E(B-V) < 0.05$ mag). This establishes the galaxy hosting GRB 160804A as one of the most luminous, massive and metal-rich GRB hosts at z < 1.5. Furthermore, the gas-phase metallicity is found to be representative of the physical conditions of the gas close to the explosion site of the burst. The high metallicity of the host galaxy is also observed in absorption, where we detect several strong FeII transitions as well as MgII and MgI. While host galaxy absorption features are common in GRB afterglow spectra, we detect absorption from strong metal lines directly in the host continuum (at a time when the afterglow was contributing to < 15%). Finally, we discuss the possibility that the geometry and state of the absorbing and emitting gas is indicative of a galactic scale outflow expelled at the final stage of two merging galaxies.},

But because these episodes are brief, quasars are rare objects typically separated by cosmological distances. In a survey for Lyman-alpha emission at redshift z $\sim$ 2, we discovered a physical association of four quasars embedded in a giant nebula. Located within a substantial overdensity of galaxies, this system is probably the progenitor of a massive galaxy cluster. The chance probability of finding a quadruple quasar is estimated to be $\sim$10^-7, implying a physical connection between Lyman-alpha nebulae and the locations of rare protoclusters. Our findings imply that the most massive structures in the distant universe have a tremendous supply ($\sim$ 10^11 solar masses) of cool dense (volume density $\sim$1 cm^-3) gas, which is in conflict with current cosmological simulations.},

abstract = {We have updated the Munich galaxy formation model to the Planck first-year cosmology, while modifying the treatment of baryonic processes to reproduce recent data on the abundance and passive fractions of galaxies from z= 3 down to z=0. Matching these more extensive and more precise observational results requires us to delay the reincorporation of wind ejecta, to lower the surface density threshold for turning cold gas into stars, to eliminate ram-pressure stripping in haloes less massive than $\sim$10^14 Msun, and to modify our model for radio mode feedback. These changes cure the most obvious failings of our previous models, namely the overly early formation of low-mass galaxies and the overly large fraction of them that are passive at late times. The new model is calibrated to reproduce the observed evolution both of the stellar mass function and of the distribution of star formation rate at each stellar mass. Massive galaxies (M>10^11 [Msun]) assemble most of their mass before z=1 and are predominantly old and passive at z=0, while lower mass galaxies assemble later and, for M<10^9.5 (Msun), are still predominantly blue and star forming at z=0. This phenomenological but physically based model allows the observations to be interpreted in terms of the efficiency of the various processes that control the formation and evolution of galaxies as a function of their stellar mass, gas content, environment and time.},

abstract = {We present a new Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) named Steve for performing type Ia supernova (SNIa) cosmology fits. This advances previous works by including an improved treatment of Malmquist bias, accounting for additional sources of systematic uncertainty, and increasing numerical efficiency. Given light curve fit parameters, redshifts, and host-galaxy masses, we fit Steve simultaneously for parameters describing cosmology, SNIa populations, and systematic uncertainties. Selection effects are characterised using Monte-Carlo simulations. We demonstrate its implementation by fitting realisations of SNIa datasets where the SNIa model closely follows that used in Steve. Next, we validate on more realistic SNANA simulations of SNIa samples from the Dark Energy Survey and low-redshift surveys. These simulated datasets contain more than $60\,000$ SNeIa, which we use to evaluate biases in the recovery of cosmological parameters, specifically the equation-of-state of dark energy, $w$. This is the most rigorous test of a BHM method applied to SNIa cosmology fitting, and reveals small $w$-biases that depend on the simulated SNIa properties, in particular the intrinsic SNIa scatter model. This $w$-bias is less than $0.03$ on average, less than half the statistical uncertainty on $w$.These simulation test results are a concern for BHM cosmology fitting applications on large upcoming surveys, and therefore future development will focus on minimising the sensitivity of Steve to the SNIa intrinsic scatter model.},

abstract = {A preponderance of evidence links long-duration, soft-spectrum gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with the death of massive stars. The observations of the GRB-supernova (SN) connection present the most direct evidence of this physical link. We summarize 30 GRB-SN associations and focus on five ironclad cases, highlighting the subsequent insight into the progenitors enabled by detailed observations. We also address the SN association (or lack thereof) with several sub-classes of GRBs, finding that the X-ray Flash (XRF) population is likely associated with massive stellar death whereas short-duration events likely arise from an older population not readily capable of producing a SN concurrent with a GRB. Interestingly, a minority population of seemingly long-duration, soft-spectrum GRBs show no evidence for SN-like activity; this may be a natural consequence of the range of Ni-56 production expected in stellar deaths.},

abstract = {Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are powerful tracers of star-forming galaxies. We have defined a homogeneous subsample of 69 Swift GRB-selected galaxies spanning a very wide redshift range. Special attention has been devoted to making the sample optically unbiased through simple and well-defined selection criteria based on the high-energy properties of the bursts and their positions on the sky. Thanks to our extensive follow-up observations, this sample has now achieved a comparatively high degree of redshift completeness, and thus provides a legacy sample, useful for statistical studies of GRBs and their host galaxies. In this paper, we present the survey design and summarize the results of our observing program conducted at the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) aimed at obtaining the most basic properties of galaxies in this sample, including a catalog of R and Ks magnitudes and redshifts. We detect the host galaxies for 80% of the GRBs in the sample, although only 42% have Ks -band detections, which confirms that GRB-selected host galaxies are generally blue. The sample is not uniformly blue, however, with two extremely red objects detected. Moreover, galaxies hosting GRBs with no optical/NIR afterglows, whose identification therefore relies on X-ray localizations, are significantly brighter and redder than those with an optical/NIR afterglow. This supports a scenario where GRBs occurring in more massive and dusty galaxies frequently suffer high optical obscuration. Our spectroscopic campaign has resulted in 77% now having redshift measurements, with a median redshift of 2.14 ± 0.18. TOUGH alone includes 17 detected z > 2 Swift GRB host galaxies suitable for individual and statistical studies—a substantial increase over previous samples. Seven hosts have detections of the Ly$\alpha$ emission line and we can exclude an early indication that Ly$\alpha$ emission is ubiquitous among GRB hosts, but confirm that Ly$\alpha$ is stronger in GRB-selected galaxies than in flux-limited samples of Lyman break galaxies.  .},

abstract = {Over the past five years evidence has mounted that long-duration (>2 s) gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)-the most luminous of all astronomical explosions-signal the collapse of massive stars in our Universe. This evidence was originally based on the probable association of one unusual GRB with a supernova, but now includes the association of GRBs with regions of massive star formation in distant galaxies, the appearance of supernova-like 'bumps' in the optical afterglow light curves of several bursts and lines of freshly synthesized elements in the spectra of a few X-ray afterglows. These observations support, but do not yet conclusively demonstrate, the idea that long-duration GRBs are associated with the deaths of massive stars, presumably arising from core collapse. Here we report evidence that a very energetic supernova (a hypernova) was temporally and spatially coincident with a GRB at redshift z = 0.1685. The timing of the supernova indicates that it exploded within a few days of the GRB, strongly suggesting that core-collapse events can give rise to GRBs, thereby favouring the 'collapsar' model.},

It is spectroscopically classified as a broad-lined stripped-envelope supernova (Ic-BL SN). The high peak luminosity ($L_{\mathrm{bol}} \gtrsim 3 \times 10^{44}$ erg $\mathrm{sec}^{-1}$), the short rise time ($t_{\mathrm{rise}}= 3$ days in $g$-band), and the blue colors at peak ($g-r\sim-0.4$) all resemble the high-redshift Ic-BL iPTF16asu, as well as several other unclassified fast transients. The early discovery of SN2018gep (within an hour of shock breakout) enabled an intensive spectroscopic campaign, including the highest-temperature ($T_{\mathrm{eff}}\gtrsim40,000$ K) spectra of a stripped-envelope SN. A retrospective search revealed luminous ($M_g \sim M_r \approx -14\,$mag) emission in the days to weeks before explosion, the first definitive detection of precursor emission for a Ic-BL. We find a limit on the isotropic gamma-ray energy release $E_\mathrm{\gamma,iso}<4.9 \times 10^{48}$ erg, a limit on X-ray emission $L_{\mathrm{X}} < 10^{40}\,$erg sec$^{-1}$, and a limit on radio emission $\nu L_\nu \lesssim 10^{37}\,$erg sec$^{-1}$. Taken together, we find that the early ($<10\,$days) data are best explained by shock breakout in a massive shell of dense circumstellar material ($0.02\,M_\odot$) at large radii ($3 \times 10^{14}\,$cm) that was ejected in eruptive pre-explosion mass-loss episodes. The late-time ($>10$ days) light curve requires an additional energy source, which could be the radioactive decay of Ni-56.},

abstract = {We present ZTF18abvkwla (the "Koala"), a fast blue optical transient discovered in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) One-Day Cadence (1DC) Survey. ZTF18abvkwla has a number of features in common with the groundbreaking transient AT2018cow: blue colors at peak ($g-r\approx-0.5$ mag), a short rise time from half-max of under two days, a decay time to half-max of only three days, a high optical luminosity ($M_{g,\mathrm{peak}}\approx-20.6$mag), a hot ($\gtrsim 40,000$K) featureless spectrum at peak light, and a luminous radio counterpart. At late times ($\Delta t>80$d) the radio luminosity of ZTF18abvkwla ($\nu L_\nu \gtrsim 10^{40}$erg/s at 10 GHz, observer-frame) is most similar to that of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The host galaxy is a dwarf starburst galaxy ($M\approx5\times10^{8}M_\odot$, $\mathrm{SFR}\approx7 M_\odot$/yr) that is moderately metal-enriched ($\log\mathrm{[O/H]} \approx 8.5$), similar to the hosts of GRBs and superluminous supernovae. As in AT2018cow, the radio and optical emission in ZTF18abvkwla likely arise from two separate components: the radio from fast-moving ejecta ($\Gamma \beta c >0.38c$) and the optical from shock-interaction with confined dense material ($<0.07M_\odot$ in $\sim 10^{15}$cm). Compiling transients in the literature with $t_\mathrm{rise} <5$d and $M_\mathrm{peak}<-20$mag, we find that a significant number are engine-powered, and suggest that the high peak optical luminosity is directly related to the presence of this engine. From 18 months of the 1DC survey, we find that transients in this rise-luminosity phase space are at least two to three orders of magnitude less common than CC SNe. Finally, we discuss strategies for identifying such events with future facilities like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, and prospects for detecting accompanying X-ray and radio emission.},

abstract = {We present detailed submillimeter- through centimeter-wave observations of the extraordinary extragalactic transient AT2018cow. The apparent characteristics -- the high radio luminosity, the long-lived emission plateau at millimeter bands, and the sub-relativistic velocity -- have no precedent. A basic interpretation of the data suggests $E_k \gtrsim 10^{48}$ erg coupled to a fast but sub-relativistic ($v \approx 0.13c$) shock in a dense ($n_e \approx 3 \times 10^{5}\,$cm$^{-3}$) medium. We find that the X-ray emission is not naturally explained by an extension of the radio-submm synchrotron spectrum, nor by inverse Compton scattering of the dominant blackbody UVOIR photons by energetic electrons within the forward shock. By $\Delta t \approx20\,$days, the X-ray emission shows spectral softening and erratic inter-day variability. Taken together, we are led to invoke an additional source of X-ray emission: the central engine of the event. Regardless of the nature of this central engine, this source heralds a new class of energetic transients shocking a dense medium, which at early times are most readily observed at millimeter wavelengths.},

abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size {\epsilon} and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter {\epsilon} on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all. NUTS is also suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" sampling algorithms.},

abstract = {We identify a "supernova rate problem": the measured cosmic core-collapse supernova rate is a factor of $\sim$ 2 smaller (with significance $\sim$ 2 sigma) than that predicted from the measured cosmic massive-star formation rate. The comparison is critical for topics from galaxy evolution and enrichment to the abundance of neutron stars and black holes. We systematically explore possible resolutions. The accuracy and precision of the star formation rate data and conversion to the supernova rate are well supported, and proposed changes would have far-reaching consequences. The dominant effect is likely that many supernovae are missed because they are either optically dim (low-luminosity) or dark, whether intrinsically or due to obscuration. We investigate supernovae too dim to have been discovered in cosmic surveys by a detailed study of all supernova discoveries in the local volume. If possible supernova impostors are included, then dim supernovae are common enough by fraction to solve the supernova rate problem. If they are not included, then the rate of dark core collapses is likely substantial. Other alternatives are that there are surprising changes in our understanding of star formation or supernova rates, including that supernovae form differently in small galaxies than in normal galaxies. These possibilities can be distinguished by upcoming supernova surveys, star formation measurements, searches for disappearing massive stars, and measurements of supernova neutrinos.},

abstract = {We present an investigation into the absorber in front of the z = 2.63 radio galaxy MRC 2025-218, using integral field spectroscopy obtained at the Very Large Telescope, and long-slit spectroscopy obtained at the Keck II telescope. The properties of MRC 2025-218 are particularly conducive to study the nature of the absorbing gas, i.e. this galaxy shows bright and spatially extended Ly[alpha] emission, along with bright continuum emission from the active nucleus. Ly[alpha] absorption is detected across $\sim$40 x 30 kpc2, has a covering factor of $\sim$1, and shows remarkably little variation in its properties across its entire spatial extent. This absorber is kinematically detached from the extended emission line region (EELR). Its properties suggest that the absorber is outside of the EELR. We derive lower limits to the H i, H ii and H column densities for this absorber of 3 x 1016, 7 x 1017 and 2 x 1018 cm-2, respectively. Moreover, the relatively bright emission from the active nucleus has allowed us to measure a number of metal absorption lines: C i, C ii, C iv, N v, O i, Si ii, Si iv, Al ii and Al iii. The column density ratios are most naturally explained using photoionization by a hard continuum, with an ionization parameter U $\sim$ 0.0005 - 0.005. Shocks or photoionization by young stars cannot reproduce satisfactorily the measured column ratios. Using the ratio between the Si ii* and Si ii column densities, we derive a lower limit of [greater than or equal to] 10 cm-3 for the electron density of the absorber. The data do not allow useful constraints to be placed on the metallicity of the absorber. We consider two possibilities for the nature of this absorber: the cosmological infall of gas, and an outflow driven by supernovae or the radio jets. We find it plausible that the absorber around 2025-218 is in outflow. We also find good agreement between the observed properties of the H i absorber and the properties of the H i absorption expected from the cosmological infall model of Barkana & Loeb.

abstract = {Until recently, dust emission has been detected in very few host galaxies of gamma-ray bursts (GRBHs). With Herschel, we have now observed 17 GRBHs up to redshift z$\sim$3 and detected seven of them at infrared (IR) wavelengths. This relatively high detection rate (41%) may be due to the composition of our sample which at a median redshift of 1.1 is dominated by the hosts of dark GRBs. Although the numbers are small, statistics suggest that dark GRBs are more likely to be detected in the IR than their optically-bright counterparts. Combining our IR data with optical, near-infrared, and radio data from our own datasets and from the literature, we have constructed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) which span up to 6 orders of magnitude in wavelength. By fitting the SEDs, we have obtained stellar masses, dust masses, star-formation rate (SFR), and extinctions for our sample galaxies. We find that GRBHs are galaxies that tend to have a high specfic SFR (sSFR), and like other star-forming galaxies, their ratios of dust-to-stellar mass are well correlated with sSFR. We incorporate our Herschel sample into a larger compilation of GRBHs, and compare this combined sample to SFR-weighted median stellar masses of the widest, deepest galaxy survey to date. This is done in order to establish whether or not GRBs can be used as an unbiased tracer of cosmic comoving SFR density (SFRD) in the universe. In contrast with previous results, this comparison shows that GRBHs are medium-sized galaxies with relatively high sSFRs; stellar masses and sSFRs of GRBHs as a function of redshift are similar to what is expected for star-forming galaxy populations at similar redshifts. We conclude that there is no strong evidence that GRBs are biased tracers of SFRD; thus they should be able to reliably probe the SFRD to early epochs.},

abstract = {This work investigates the effect of the aperture size on derived galaxy properties for which we have spatially-resolved optical spectra. We focus on some indicators of star formation activity and dust attenuation for spiral galaxies that have been widely used in previous work on galaxy evolution. We have used 104 spiral galaxies from the CALIFA survey for which 2D spectroscopy with complete spatial coverage is available. From the 3D cubes we have derived growth curves of the most conspicuous Balmer emission lines (Halpha, Hbeta) for circular apertures of different radii centered at the galaxy's nucleus after removing the underlying stellar continuum. We find that the Halpha flux (f(Halpha)) growth curve follows a well defined sequence with aperture radius showing low dispersion around the median value. From this analysis, we derive aperture corrections for galaxies in different magnitude and redshift intervals. Once stellar absorption is properly accounted for, the f(Halpha)/f(Hbeta) ratio growth curve shows a smooth decline, pointing towards the absence of differential dust attenuation as a function of radius. Aperture corrections as a function of the radius are provided in the interval [0.3,2.5]R_50. Finally, the Halpha equivalent width (EW(Halpha)) growth curve increases with the size of the aperture and shows a very large dispersion for small apertures. This large dispersion prevents the use of reliable aperture corrections for this quantity. In addition, this result suggests that separating star-forming and quiescent galaxies based on observed EW(Halpha) through small apertures is likely to result in low EW(Halpha) star-forming galaxies begin classified as quiescent.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the evolution of the dust-to-metal ratio in galaxies based on a simple evolution model for the amount of metal and dust with infall. We take into account grain formation in stellar mass-loss gas, grain growth by the accretion of metallic atoms in a cold dense cloud, and grain destruction by SNe shocks. Especially, we propose that the accretion efficiency is independent of the star-formation history. This predicts various evolutionary tracks in the metallicity ($Z$)--dust-to-gas ratio ($\cal D$) plane depending on the star-formation history. In this framework, the observed linear $Z$--$\cal D$ relation of nearby spiral galaxies can be interpreted as a sequence of a constant galactic age. We emphasize that an observational study of the $Z$--$\cal D$ relation of galaxies at $z\sim 1$ is very useful to constrain the efficiencies of dust growth and destruction. We also suggest that the Lyman break galaxies at $z\sim 3$ have a very low dust-to-metal ratio, typically $\ltsim 0.1$. Although the effect of infall on the evolutionary tracks in the $Z$--$\cal D$ plane is quite small, the dispersion of the infall rate can disturb the $Z$--$\cal D$ relation with a constant galactic age.},

abstract = {A small group of the newly discovered superluminous supernovae show broad and slowly evolving light curves. Here we present extensive observational data for the slow-evolving superluminous supernova LSQ14an, which brings this group of transients to four in total in the low redshift Universe (z$<$0.2; SN 2007bi, PTF12dam, SN 2015bn). We particularly focus on the optical and near-infrared evolution during the period from 50 days up to 400 days from peak, showing that they are all fairly similar in their light curve and spectral evolution. LSQ14an shows broad, blue-shifted [O III] $\lambda\lambda$4959, 5007 lines, as well as a blue-shifted [O II] $\lambda\lambda$7320, 7330 and [Ca II] $\lambda\lambda$7291, 7323. Furthermore, the sample of these four objects shows common features. Semi-forbidden and forbidden emission lines appear surprisingly early at 50-70 days and remain visible with almost no variation up to 400 days. The spectra remain blue out to 400 days. There are small, but discernible light curve fluctuations in all of them. The light curve of each shows a faster decline than $^{56}$Co after 150 days and it further steepens after 300 days. We also expand our analysis presenting X-ray limits for LSQ14an and SN2015bn and discuss their diagnostic power in interpreting their common features. These features are quite distinct from the faster evolving superluminous supernovae and are not easily explained in terms of only a variation in ejecta mass. While a central engine is still the most likely luminosity source, it appears that the ejecta structure is complex, with multiple emitting zones and at least some interaction between the expanding ejecta and surrounding material.},

abstract = {We present the first neutral hydrogen images of the edge-on, IR-bright spiral galaxy, NGC 5775, and its companion, NGC 5774. Several H I arcs and extensions are observed out to approximately 8 kpc from the plane of NGC 5775 and resemble the Heiles shells observed in the Milky Way and similar features seen in NGC 891 and NGC 3079. NGC 5775 and NGC 5774 are clearly interacting, with gas apparently transferring from NGC 5774 to NGC 5775 along two connecting H I bridges. Faint optical emission as well as radio continuum emission are also present along the bridges, but no strong optical distortions or tidal tails are associated with either galaxy. We suggest that this system may be in the early stages of a merger. The parameters of the H I velocity and density distributions of NGC 5775 have been modeled using the technique of Irwin {&} Seaquist (1991) for edge-on galaxies. The density distributions are best described by a Gaussian ring in the galaxy plane and an exponential distribution perpendicular to the plane. The velocity distribution is well fitted with a classical Brandt rotation curve, but the fits are not particularly sensitive to the shape of this curve. An internal velocity dispersion (representing all internal sources of noncircular velocities) of order 24 km/sec is also required. NGC 5774, of low inclination, has been modeled from the moments of the H I distribution. Its internal velocity dispersion is also relatively high, and high-velocity dispersion knots are also present.},

abstract = {Here we present an integral-field study of the massive, high-metallicity spiral NGC 3191, the host of SN 2017egm, the closest SLSN Type I to date. We use data from PMAS/CAHA and the public MaNGA survey to shed light on the properties of the SLSN site and the origin of star-formation in this non-starburst spiral galaxy. We map the physical properties different \ion{H}{II} regions throughout the galaxy and characterize their stellar populations using the STARLIGHT fitting code. Kinematical information allows to study a possible interaction with its neighbouring galaxy as the origin of recent star formation activity which could have caused the SLSN. NGC 3191 shows intense star-formation in the western part with three large SF regions of low metallicity. The central regions of the host have a higher metallicity, lower specific star-formation rate and lower ionization. Modeling the stellar populations gives a different picture: The SLSN region has two dominant stellar populations with different ages, the youngest one with an age of 2-10 Myr and lower metallicity, likely the population from which the SN progenitor originated. Emission line kinematics of NGC 3191 show indications of interaction with its neighbour MCG+08-19-017 at $\sim$45 kpc, which might be responsible for the recent starburst. In fact, this galaxy pair has in total hosted 4 SNe, 1988B (Type Ia), SN 2003ds (Type Ic in MCG+08-19-017), PTF10bgl (SLSN-Type II) and 2017egm, underlying the enhanced SF in both galaxies due to interaction. Our study shows that one has to be careful interpreting global host and even gas properties without looking at the stellar population history of the region. SLSNe seem to still be consistent with massive stars ($>$ 20 M$_\odot$) requiring low ($< 0.6Z_{\odot}$) metallicity and those environments can also occur in massive, late-type galaxies but not necessarily starbursts.},

abstract = {Aims. We attempt to constrain progenitors of the different types of supernovae from their spatial distributions relative to star formation regions in their host galaxies, as traced by H$\alpha$ + [NII] line emission. Methods. We analyse 63 supernovae which have occurred within galaxies from our H$\alpha$ survey of the local Universe. Three statistical tests are used, based on pixel statistics, H$\alpha$ radial growth curves, and total galaxy emission-line fluxes. Results. Many type II supernovae come from regions of low or zero emission line flux, and more than would be expected if the latter accurately traces high-mass star formation. We interpret this excess as a 40% "Runaway" fraction in the progenitor stars. Supernovae of types Ib and Ic do appear to trace star formation activity, with a much higher fraction coming from the centres of bright star formation regions than is the case for the type II supernovae. Type Ia supernovae overall show a weak correlation with locations of current star formation, but there is evidence that a significant minority, up to about 40%, may be linked to the young stellar population. The radial distribution of all core-collapse supernovae (types Ib, Ic and II) closely follows that of the line emission and hence star formation in their host galaxies, apart from a central deficiency which is less marked for supernovae of types Ib and Ic than for those of type II. Core-collapse supernova rates overall are consistent with being proportional to galaxy total luminosities and star formation rates; however, within this total the type Ib and Ic supernovae show a moderate bias towards more luminous host galaxies, and type II supernovae a slight bias towards lower-luminosity hosts. {\textcopyright} ESO 2006.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} ESO, 2015. We use gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow spectra observed with the VLT/X-Shooter spectrograph to measure rest-frame extinction in GRB lines-of-sight by modelling the broadband near-infrared (NIR) to X-ray afterglow spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Our sample consists of nine Swift GRBs, of which eight belong to the long-duration and one to the short-duration class. Dust is modelled using the average extinction curves of the Milky Way and the two Magellanic Clouds. We derive the rest-frame extinction of the entire sample, which fall in the range 0 ? A < inf > V < /inf >  ? 1.2. Moreover, the SMC extinction curve is the preferred extinction curve template for the majority of our sample, a result that is in agreement with those commonly observed in GRB lines of sights. In one analysed case (GRB? 120119A), the common extinction curve templates fail to reproduce the observed extinction. To illustrate the advantage of using the high-quality, X-Shooter afterglow SEDs over the photometric SEDs, we repeat the modelling using the broadband SEDs with the NIR-to-UV photometric measurements instead of the spectra. The main result is that the spectroscopic data, thanks to a combination of excellent resolution and coverage of the blue part of the SED, are more successful in constraining extinction curves and therefore dust properties in GRB hosts with respect to photometric measurements. In all cases but one the extinction curve of one template is preferred over the others. We show that themodelled values of the extinction A < inf > V < /inf >  and the spectral slope, obtained through spectroscopic and photometric SED analysis, can differ significantly for individual events, though no apparent trend in the differences is observed. Finally we stress that, regardless of the resolution of the optical-to-NIR data, the SED modelling gives reliable results only when the fit is performed on a SED covering a broader spectral region (in our case extending to X-rays).},

abstract = {Aims. Long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) are associated with massive stars and are therefore linked to star formation. However, the conditions needed for the progenitor stars to produce LGRBs can affect the relation between the LGRB rate and star formation. By using the power of a complete LGRB sample, our long-term aim is to understand whether such a bias exists and, if it does, what its origin is. Methods. To reach our goal we use the Swf/BAT6 complete sample of LGRBs. In this first paper, we build the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the 14 z < 1 host galaxies of the BAT6 LGRB sample and determine their stellar masses (M*) from SED fitting. To investigate the presence of a bias in the LGRB-star formation relation we compare the stellar mass distribution of the LGRB host galaxies (i) with star-forming galaxies observed in deep surveys (UltraVISTA) within the same redshift limit; (ii) with semi-analytical models of the z < 1 star-forming galaxy population; and (iii) with dedicated numerical simulations of LGRB hosts having different metallicity thresholds for the progenitor star environment. Results. We find that at z < 1, LGRBs tend to avoid massive galaxies and are very powerful for selecting a population of faint low-mass star-forming galaxies, partly below the completeness limits of galaxy surveys. The stellar mass distribution of the hosts is not consistent with that of the UltraVISTA star-forming galaxies weighted by their star formation rate (SFR). This implies that, at least at z < 1, LGRBs are not unbiased tracers of star formation. To make the two distributions consistent, a much steeper faint end of the mass function would be required or a very shallow SFR-mass relation for the low-mass galaxy population. The comparison with the GRB host galaxy simulations indicates that, to reproduce the stellar mass distribution, a metallicity threshold of the order of Zth = 0.3-0.5 Z0 is necessary to form a LGRB. Models without a metallicity threshold or with an extreme threshold of Z& = 0.1 Z0 are excluded at z < 1. Under a very basic assumption, we estimate that the LGRB rate can directly trace the SFR starting from z $\sim$ 4 and above. Conclusions. GRB hosts at z < 1 have lower luminosities and stellar masses than expected if LGRBs were unbiased star formation tracers. The use of the Swft/BAT6 complete sample keeps this result from being affected by possible biases that could have influenced past results based on incomplete samples. The preference for low metallicities (Z < 0.5 Z0) inferred by the comparison with the simulations can be a consequence of the particular conditions needed for the progenitor star to produce a GRB.

abstract = {Broad-line Ic supernovae (SNe Ic-BL) are a very rare class of core-collapse supernovae exhibiting high ejecta velocities and high kinetic energies. They are the only type of SNe that accompany long gamma-ray burst (GRB) explosions. Systematic differences found in the spectra of SNe Ic-BL with and without GRBs (GRB-SNe and SNe Ic-BL, respectively) could either be due to differences in the progenitor or/and explosion mechanism of SNe Ic-BL caused by the presence or absence of a GRB, or solely to differences in the viewing angle of the observer with respect to the orientation of the collimated explosion. We present the systematic comparison of the host galaxies of broad-lined SNe Ic with and without a detected GRB, the latter being detected in untargeted surveys, with the aim to find out whether there are any systematic differences between the environments in which these two classes of SNe preferentially explode. We study photometric properties of the host galaxies of a sample of 8 GRB-SNe and a sample of 28 SNe Ic-BL at z < 0.2. The two galaxy samples have indistinguishable luminosity and proper size distribution. We find indications that GRB-SNe on average occur closer to the centres of their host galaxies, that is, the samples have a different distribution of projected offsets, normalized by the galaxy sizes. In addition, we compare gas-phase metallicities of the GRB-SNe and SNe Ic-BL host samples and find that a larger fraction of super-solar metallicity hosts are found among the SNe Ic-BL without a GRB. Our results are indicative of a genuine difference between the two types of explosions and suggest that the viewing angle is not the main source of difference in the spectra of the two classes. We discuss the implications that our results have on our understanding of progenitors of SNe Ic-BL with and without a GRB.},

abstract = {We report on the highly extinguished afterglow of GRB 070306 and the properties of the host galaxy. An optical afterglow was not detected at the location of the burst, but in near-infrared a doubling in brightness during the first night and later power-law decay in the K band provided a clear detection of the afterglow. The host galaxy is relatively bright, R ∼ 22.8. An optical low-resolution spectrum revealed a largely featureless host galaxy continuum with a single emission line. Higher resolution follow-up spectroscopy shows this emission to be resolved and consisting of two peaks separated by 7 {\AA}, suggesting it to be [O II] at a redshift of z = 1.49594 ±0.00006. The infrared color H - K = 2 directly reveals significant reddening. By modeling the optical/X-ray spectral energy distribution at t = 1.38 days with an extinguished synchrotron spectrum, we derive AV = 5.5 ±0.6 mag. This is among the largest values ever measured for a GRB afterglow, and visual extinctions exceeding unity are rare. The importance of early near-IR observations is obvious and may soon provide a clearer view into the once elusive "dark bursts." {\textcopyright} 2008. The American Astronomical Society.

abstract = {We present data on the gas phase abundances for 9 different elements in the interstellar medium of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), based on the strengths of ultraviolet absorption features over relevant velocities in the spectra of 18 stars within the SMC. From this information and the total abundances defined by the element fractions in young stars in the SMC, we construct a general interpretation on how these elements condense into solid form onto dust grains. As a group, the elements Si, S, Cr, Fe, Ni, and Zn exhibit depletion sequences similar to those in the local part of our Galaxy defined by Jenkins (2009). The elements Mg and Ti deplete less rapidly in the SMC than in the Milky Way, and Mn depletes more rapidly. We speculate that these differences might be explained by the different chemical affinities to different existing grain substrates. For instance, there is evidence that the mass fractions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the SMC are significantly lower than those in the Milky Way. We propose that the depletion sequences that we observed for the SMC may provide a better model for interpreting the element abundances in low metallicity Damped Lyman Alpha (DLA) and sub-DLA absorption systems that are recorded in the spectra of distant quasars and gamma ray burst afterglows.},

Our results are as follows. (1) Among 790 high-mass (M≥ 2.5 × 1010 M ⊙) galaxies, the visually based merger fraction over z 0.24-0.80, ranges from 9% 5% to 8% 2%. Lower limits on the major merger and minor merger fraction over this interval range from 1.1% to 3.5%, and 3.6% to 7.5%, respectively. This is the first, albeit approximate, empirical estimate of the frequency of minor mergers over the last 7Gyr. Assuming a visibility timescale of 0.5Gyr, it follows that over T b 3-7Gyr, 68% of high-mass systems have undergone a merger of mass ratio >1/10, with 16%, 45%, and 7% of these corresponding respectively to major, minor, and ambiguous "major or minor" mergers. The average merger rate is a few ×10-4 galaxiesGyr-1 Mpc-3. Among 2840 blue-cloud galaxies of mass M≥ 1.0 × 109 M ⊙, similar results hold. (2) We compare the empirical merger fraction and merger rate for high-mass galaxies to three $\Lambda$ cold dark matter-based models: halo occupation distribution models, semi-analytic models, and hydrodynamic SPH simulations. We find qualitative agreement between observations and models such that the (major+minor) merger fraction or rate from different models bracket the observations, and show a factor of 5 dispersion. Near-future improvements can now start to rule out certain merger scenarios. (3) Among 3698 M≥ 1.0 × 109 M ⊙ galaxies, we find that the mean star formation rate (SFR) of visibly merging systems is only modestly enhanced compared to non-interacting galaxies over z 0.24-0.80. Visibly merging systems only account for a small fraction (<30%) of the cosmic SFR density over T b 3-7Gyr. This complements the results of Wolf etal. over a shorter time interval of T b 6.2-6.8Gyr, and suggests that the behavior of the cosmic SFR density over the last 7Gyr is predominantly shaped by non-interacting galaxies. {\textcopyright} 2009.

abstract = {We review the use of elemental depletions in determining the composition of interstellar dust and present a new interpretation of the elemental depletion patterns for the dust forming elements in a range of diffuse cloud types. We discuss this within the context of dust processing in the interstellar medium and show that Si and Mg are selectively eroded from dust, with respect to Fe, as expected for a sputtering erosion process. However, we find that Si is preferentially and nonstoichiometrically eroded from dust with respect to Mg by some as yet unidentified process that may act in conjunction with grain sputtering. On this basis a new way of interpreting the depletions in terms of ``continuous'' dust processing through erosion in the interstellar medium is presented. The observed depletion patterns can then be understood in terms of a gradually changing grain chemical composition as the erosion of the atoms proceeds nonstoichiometrically in the low-density interstellar medium. The stoichiometric erosion of multicomponent (e.g., core/mantle) single grains can qualitatively explain the observed depletions but is not consistent with the preferential erosion of Si from dust. We present suggestions for the usage of mineralogical terms within the context of interstellar and circumstellar dust mineralogy.},

abstract = {We have studied the effects of shattering in grain-grain collisions. Based upon extensive numerical simulation of surface explosions and impacts, an analytical model has been developed which relates the final crater mass and fragment size distribution to the relative collision velocity, grain sizes, and material properties of projectile and target. Our model contains one free parameter, the critical shock pressure for shattering. We have compared the calculated crater masses to laboratory experiments on (sub)micron-sized particle impacts on a wide variety of materials and find good agreement assuming that the critical pressure for shattering is equal to the shear strength of the material. This critical pressure corresponds to minimum collision velocities of ˜1 km s-1 for shattering to occur. The shattering threshold is much smaller than the vaporization threshold, and we therefore conclude that shattering dominates over vaporization in grain-grain collisions. The calculated size distribution of the shattered fragments scales with a a-3.3; slightly less steep than the Mathis, Rumpl, & Nordsieck (MRN) size distribution. Essentially, any shattering model where the size of the fragments is related to the pressure experienced will lead to fragment power-law size distributions with indices slightly steeper than ˜3. The maximum fragment size increases with increasing crater size (i.e., increasing collision velocity) until the target grain is completely disrupted by the collision. For higher velocity collisions, our theory predicts that the maximum shattered fragment size will decrease again. Dust destruction (return of grain mass to the gas) in the interstellar medium occurs predominantly in shock waves in the warm neutral/ionized medium (density ≃0.25 cm-3, temperature ˜104 K). The new theory for grain shattering in grain-grain collisions has been incorporated into a grain destruction code and used to reevaluate the grain destruction rate in interstellar shocks in the warm medium. We find that, for all the grain materials we consider (graphite, silicate, silicon carbide, diamond, iron, and ice) nonthermal and thermal sputtering dominate the grain destruction. We also find that grain disruption (shattering) in grain-grain collisions dominates the grain mass redistribution. We present detailed results for grain destruction as a function of the grain size and composition. In particular, we consider MRN size distributions of silicate and carbonaceous (amorphous carbon/ graphite) grains. We also present results for silicon carbide, diamond, iron, and ice test particles. For both carbonaceous and silicate grains we find that the fractional destruction (i.e., return of solid material to the gas phase) is ≤0.5, for vs ≤200 km s-1 . The grain lifetimes against destruction, assuming the three-phase model of the interstellar medium, are 6 x 108 yr, and 4 x 108 yr, for carbonaceous and silicate grains, respectively, only slightly longer than previous studies that ignored shattering. Grain shattering in grain-grain collisions in shock waves leads to the redistribution of the dust mass from large grains (a ≥ 1000 {\AA}) into small grains (a < 500 {\AA}). After processing by a single shock, a major fraction of the grains larger than 300 A have experienced shattering grain-grain collisions. The slope of the fragment size distribution produced in single collisions has little influence on the size distribution produced by shocks. Essentially, the resulting grain size distribution is slightly steeper than MRN, because the largest grains move at the highest postshock velocities and hence are preferentially shattered into the smallest fragments. Large grains are lost from the interstellar grain size distribution on time scales less than 108 yr in the warm medium. For 50 km s-1 ≤ vs ≤ 200 km s-1 as much as 5%-15% of the initial grain mass (all grain radii ≥ 50 {\AA}) may end up in sub-14 {\AA} fragments. Thus, interstellar shocks may be a prodigious source of PAH molecules, PAH clusters, and small grains. Given that the typical stardust injection time scale is 2.5 x 109 yr, we conclude that efficient mechanisms for grain growth, and in particular, the reformation of grains with radii> 1000 {\AA}, must exist in interstellar medium in order that the refractory elements be incorporated in dust and that most of the dust mass is in sizes ≥ 1000 {\AA}, as observed.},

abstract = {Recent analyses suggest that distance residuals measured from Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are correlated with local host galaxy properties within a few kpc of the SN explosion. However, the well-established correlation with global host galaxy properties is nearly as significant, with a shift of 0.06 mag across a low to high mass boundary (the mass step). Here, with 273 SNe Ia at $z<0.1$, we investigate whether stellar masses and rest-frame $u-g$ colors of regions within 1.5 kpc of the SN Ia explosion site are significantly better correlated with SN distance measurements than global properties or properties measured at random locations in SN hosts. At $\lesssim2\sigma$ significance, local properties tend to correlate with distance residuals better than properties at random locations, though despite using the largest low-$z$ sample to date we cannot definitively prove that a local correlation is more significant than a random correlation. Our data hint that SNe observed by surveys that do not target a pre-selected set of galaxies may have a larger local mass step than SNe from surveys that do, an increase of $0.071\pm0.036$ mag (2.0$\sigma$). We find a $3\sigma$ local mass step after global mass correction, evidence that SNe Ia should be corrected for their local mass, but we note that this effect is insignificant in the targeted low-$z$ sample. Only the local mass step remains significant at $>2\sigma$ after global mass correction, and we conservatively estimate a systematic shift in H$_0$ measurements of -0.14 $\textrm{km}\,\textrm{s}^{-1}\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ with an additional uncertainty of 0.14 $\textrm{km}\,\textrm{s}^{-1}\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, $\sim$10\% of the present uncertainty.},

abstract = {We present the chemical abundance measurements of the first large, medium-resolution, uniformly selected damped Lyman alpha system (DLA) survey. The sample contains 99 DLAs towards 89 quasars selected from the SDSS DR5 DLA sample in a uniform way. We analyze the metallicities and kinematic diagnostics, including the velocity width of 90% of the optical depth, \Delta v_{90}, and the equivalent widths of the SiII 1526, CIV 1548 and MgII 2796 transitions. To avoid strong line-saturation effects on the metallicities measured in medium-resolution spectra (FWHM$\sim$71 km/s), we derived metallicities from metal transitions which absorbed at most 35% of the quasar continuum flux. We find the evolution in cosmic mean metallicity of the sample, <Z> = (-0.04 +- 0.013)z -(1.06 +- 0.36), consistent with no evolution over the redshift range z $\sim$ [2.2, 4.4], but note that the majority of our sample falls at z $\sim$ [2.2, 3.5]. The apparent lack of metallicity evolution with redshift is also seen in a lack of evolution in the median \Delta v_{90} and SiII 1526 equivalent width values. While this result may seem to conflict with other large surveys that have detected significant metallicity evolution, such as Rafelski et al. 2012 who found <Z> = (-0.22 +- 0.03)z - (0.65 +- 0.09) over z $\sim$ [0, 5], several tests show that these surveys are not inconsistent with our new result. However, over the smaller redshift range covered by our uniformly-selected sample, the true evolution of the cosmic mean metallicity in DLAs may be somewhat flatter than the Rafelski et al. 2012 estimate.},

It uses 1.8m telescopes with very large (7 square degree) field of view and revolutionary1.4 billion pixel CCD cameras with low noise and rapid read-out to provide broad-band imaging from 400-1000nm wavelength. The first single telescope system, PS1, has been deployed on Haleakala on Maui, and has been collecting science quality survey data for approximately six months. PS1 will be joined by a second telescope PS2 in approximately 18 months. A four aperture system is planned to become operational following the end of the PS1 mission. This will be able to scan the entire visible sky to approximately 24th magnitude in less than a week, thereby meeting the goals set out by the NAS 2000 decadal review for a "Large Synoptic Sky Telescope". Here we review the technical design, and give an update on the progress that has been made with the PS1 system.},

abstract = {We study the evolution of quiescent galaxies at 0.5<z<2.5 as a function of stellar mass, using very deep NIR imaging data taken with the Multi-Object Infrared Camera and Spectrograph on the Subaru Telescope in the GOODS-North region. The deep NIR data allow us to construct a stellar mass-limited sample of quiescent galaxies down to $\sim$10^{10} Msun even at z$\sim$2 for the first time. We selected quiescent galaxies with age/tau>6 by performing SED fitting of the multi broad-band photometry from the U to Spitzer 5.8um bands with the population synthesis model of Bruzual & Charlot (2003) where exponentially decaying star formation histories are assumed. The number density of quiescent galaxies increases by a factor of $\sim$3 from 1.0<z<1.5 to 0.5<z<1.0, and by a factor of $\sim$10 from 1.5<z<2.5 to 0.5<z<1.0, while that of star-forming galaxies with age/tau<4 increases only by factors of $\sim$2 and $\sim$3 in the same redshift ranges. At 0.5<z<2.5, the low-mass slope of the stellar mass function of quiescent galaxies is alpha $\sim$ 0 -- 0.6, which is significantly flatter than those of star-forming galaxies (alpha $\sim$ -1.3 -- -1.5). As a result, the fraction of quiescent galaxies in the overall galaxy population increases with stellar mass in the redshift range. The fraction of quiescent galaxies at 10^{11}-10^{11.5} Msun increases from $\sim$20-30% at z$\sim$2 to $\sim$40-60% at z$\sim$0.75, while that at 10^{10}-10^{10.5} Msun increases from <$\sim$ 5% to $\sim$15% in the same redshift range. These results could suggest that the quenching of star formation had been more effective in more massive galaxies at 1<$\sim$z<$\sim$2. Such a mass-dependent quenching could explain the rapid increase of the number density of $\sim$M* galaxies relative to lower-mass galaxies at z >$\sim$ 1-1.5.},

The angular resolution of the combined material is HPBW $\sim$ 0.6deg. The LSR velocity coverage spans the interval -450 km s-1 to +400 km s-1, at a resolution of 1.3 km s-1. The data were corrected for stray radiation at the Institute for Radioastronomy of the University of Bonn, refining the original correction applied to the LDS. The rms brightness-temperature noise of the merged database is 0.07-0.09 K. Residual errors in the profile wings due to defects in the correction for stray radiation are for most of the data below a level of 20-40 mK. It would be necessary to construct a telescope with a main beam efficiency of $\eta$MB ⪆ 99% to achieve the same accuracy.

Gaia16apd was followed as a part of the NOT Unbiased Transient Survey (NUTS). It is one of the closest SLSNe known ($z = 0.102\pm0.001$), with detailed optical and ultraviolet (UV) observations covering the peak. Gaia16apd is a spectroscopically typical type Ic SLSN, exhibiting the characteristic blue early spectra with O II absorption, and reaches a peak $M_{g} = -21.8 \pm 0.1$ mag. However, photometrically it exhibits an evolution intermediate between the fast- and slowly-declining type Ic SLSNe, with an early evolution closer to the fast-declining events. Together with LSQ12dlf, another SLSN with similar properties, it demonstrates a possible continuum between fast- and slowly-declining events. It is unusually UV-bright even for a SLSN, reaching a non-$K$-corrected $M_{uvm2} \simeq -23.3$ mag, the only other type Ic SLSN with similar UV brightness being SN 2010gx. Assuming that Gaia16apd was powered by magnetar spin-down, we derive a period of $P = 1.9\pm0.2$ ms and a magnetic field of $B = 1.9\pm0.2 \times 10^{14}$ G for the magnetar. The estimated ejecta mass is between 8 and 16 $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and the kinetic energy between 1.3 and $2.5 \times 10^{52}$ erg, depending on opacity and assuming that the entire ejecta is swept up into a thin shell. Despite the early photometric differences, the spectra at late times are similar to slowly-declining type Ic SLSNe, implying that the two subclasses originate from similar progenitors.},

abstract = {Afterglows of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are simple in the most basic model, but can show many complex features. The ultra-long duration GRB 111209A, one of the longest GRBs ever detected, also has the best-monitored afterglow in this rare class of GRBs. We want to address the question whether GRB 111209A was a special event beyond its extreme duration alone, and whether it is a classical GRB or another kind of high-energy transient. The afterglow may yield significant clues. We present afterglow photometry obtained in seven bands with the GROND imager as well as in further seven bands with the UVOT telescope on-board the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. The light curve is analysed by multi-band modelling and joint fitting with power-laws and broken power-laws, and we use the contemporaneous GROND data to study the evolution of the spectral energy distribution. We compare the optical afterglow to a large ensemble we have analysed in earlier works, and especially to that of another ultra-long event, GRB 130925A. We furthermore undertake a photometric study of the host galaxy. We find a strong, chromatic rebrightening event at approx 0.8 days after the GRB, during which the spectral slope becomes redder. After this, the light curve decays achromatically, with evidence for a break at about 9 days after the trigger. The afterglow luminosity is found to not be exceptional. We find that a double-jet model is able to explain the chromatic rebrightening. The afterglow features have been detected in other events and are not unique. The duration aside, the GRB prompt emission and afterglow parameters of GRB 111209A are in agreement with the known distributions for these parameters. While the central engine of this event may differ from that of classical GRBs, there are multiple lines of evidence pointing to GRB 111209A resulting from the core-collapse of a massive star with a stripped envelope.},

abstract = {GRB 111209A, one of the longest Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) ever observed, is linked to SN 2011kl, the most luminous GRB-Supernova (SN) detected so far, which shows evidence for being powered by a magnetar central engine. We place SN 2011kl into the context of large samples of SNe, addressing in more detail the question of whether it could be radioactively powered, and whether it represents an extreme version of a GRB-SN or an underluminous Superluminous SN (SLSN). We model SN 2011kl using SN 1998bw as a template and derive a bolometric light curve including near-infrared data. We compare the properties of SN 2011kl to literature results on stripped-envelope and superluminous supernovae. Comparison in the k,s context, i.e., comparing it to SN 1998bw templates in terms of luminosity and light-curve stretch, clearly shows SN 2011kl is the most luminous GRB-SN to date, and it is spectrally very dissimilar to other events, being significantly bluer/hotter. Although SN 2011kl does not reach the classical luminosity threshold of SLSNe and evolves faster than any of them, it resembles SLSNe more than the classical GRB-associated broad-lined Type Ic SNe in several aspects. GRB 111209A was a very energetic event, both at early (prompt emission) and at very late (SN) times. We have shown in a further publication that with the exception of the extreme duration, the GRB and afterglow parameters are in agreement with the known distributions for these parameters. SN 2011kl, on the other hand, is exceptional both in luminosity and spectral characteristics, indicating that GRB 111209A was likely not powered by a standard-model collapsar central engine, further supporting our earlier conclusions. Instead, it reveals the possibility of a direct link between GRBs and SLSNe.},

abstract = {For the initial mass range (140 < M < 260 Msun) stars die in a thermonuclear runaway triggered by the pair-production instability. The supernovae they make can be remarkably energetic (up to $\sim$10^53 ergs) and synthesize considerable amounts of radioactive isotopes. Here we model the evolution, explosion, and observational signatures of representative pair-instability supernovae (PI SNe) spanning a range of initial masses and envelope structures. The predicted light curves last for hundreds of days and range in luminosity, from very dim to extremely bright, L $\sim$ 10^44 ergs/s. The most massive events are bright enough to be seen at high redshift, but the extended light curve duration ($\sim$1 year) -- prolonged by cosmological time-dilation -- may make it difficult to detect them as transients. An alternative approach may be to search for the brief and luminous outbreak occurring when the explosion shock wave reaches the stellar surface. Using a multi-wavelength radiation-hydrodynamics code we calculate that, in the rest-frame, the shock breakout transients of PI SNe reach luminosities of 10^45-10^46 ergs/s, peak at wavelengths $\sim$30-170 Angstroms, and last for several hours. We explore the detectability of PI SNe emission at high redshift, and discuss how observations of the light curves, spectra, and breakout emission can be used to constrain the mass, radius, and metallicity of the progenitor.},

They have not yet been definitively identified with any other astronomical object or phenomenon. The bursts are strongly dispersed, indicating passage through a high column density of low density plasma. The most economical interpretation is that this is the interglactic medium, indicating that FRB are at "cosmological" distances with redshifts in the range 0.3--1.3. Their inferred brightness temperatures are as high as $10^{37\,\circ}$K, implying coherent emission by "bunched" charges, as in radio pulsars. I review the astronomical sites, objects and emission processes that have been proposed as the origin of FRB, with particular attention to Soft Gamma Repeaters and giant pulsar pulses.},

abstract = {We develop a new method to constrain the star formation histories, dust attenuation and stellar masses of galaxies. It is based on two stellar absorption-line indices, the 4000-{\AA} break strength and the Balmer absorption-line index H$\delta$A. Together, these indices allow us to constrain the mean stellar ages of galaxies and the fractional stellar mass formed in bursts over the past few Gyr. A comparison with broad-band photometry then yields estimates of dust attenuation and of stellar mass. We generate a large library of Monte Carlo realizations of different star formation histories, including starbursts of varying strength and a range of metallicities. We use this library to generate median likelihood estimates of burst mass fractions, dust attenuation strengths, stellar masses and stellar mass-to-light ratios for a sample of 122 808 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The typical 95 per cent confidence range in our estimated stellar masses is ±40 per cent. We study how the stellar mass-to-light ratios of galaxies vary as a function of absolute magnitude, concentration index and photometric passband and how dust attenuation varies as a function of absolute magnitude and 4000-{\AA} break strength. We also calculate how the total stellar mass of the present Universe is distributed over galaxies as a function of their mass, size, concentration, colour, burst mass fraction and surface mass density. We find that most of the stellar mass in the local Universe resides in galaxies that have, to within a factor of approximately 2, stellar masses ∼5 × 1010 M⊙, half-light radii ∼3 kpc and half-light surface mass densities ∼109 M⊙ kpc-2. The distribution of Dn(4000) is strongly bimodal, showing a clear division between galaxies dominated by old stellar populations and galaxies with more recent star formation.},

abstract = {From Sloan Digital Sky Survey u′g′r′i′z′ imaging, we estimate the stellar masses of the host galaxies of 70 low-redshift Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa, 0.015 <z< 0.08) from the hosts' absolute luminosities and mass-to-light ratios. These nearby SNe were discovered largely by searches targeting luminous galaxies, and we find that their host galaxies are substantially more massive than the hosts of SNe discovered by the flux-limited Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS). Testing four separate light curve fitters, we detect ∼ 2.5$\sigma$ correlations of Hubble residuals with both host galaxy size and stellar mass, such that SNeIa occurring in physically larger, more massive hosts are 10% brighter after light curve correction. The Hubble residual is the deviation of the inferred distance modulus to the SN, calculated from its apparent luminosity and light curve properties, away from the expected value at the SN redshift. Marginalizing over linear trends in Hubble residuals with light curve parameters shows that the correlations cannot be attributed to a light-curve-dependent calibration error. Combining 180 higher-redshift ESSENCE, SNLS, and HigherZ SNe with 30 nearby SNe whose host masses are less than 1010.8 M ⊙ in a cosmology fit yields 1 + w = 0.22+0.152-0.108, while a combination where the 30 nearby SNe instead have host masses greater than 1010.8 M ⊙ yields 1 + w = -0.03+0.217-0.143. Progenitor metallicity, stellar population age, and dust extinction correlate with galaxy mass and may be responsible for these systematic effects. Host galaxy measurements will yield improved distances to SNeIa. {\textcopyright} 2010. The American Astronomical Society.},

abstract = {We have used images and spectra of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to examine the host galaxies of 519 nearby supernovae (SN). The colors at the sites of the explosions, as well as chemical abundances, and specific star formation rates (SFRs) of the host galaxies provide circumstantial evidence on the origin of each SN type. We examine separately SN II, SN IIn, SN IIb, SN Ib, SN Ic, and SN Ic with broad lines (SN Ic-BL). For host galaxies that have multiple spectroscopic fibers, we select the fiber with host radial offset most similar to that of the SN. Type Ic SN explode at small host offsets, and their hosts have exceptionally strongly star-forming, metal-rich, and dusty stellar populations near their centers. The SN Ic-BL and SN IIb explode in exceptionally blue locations, and, in our sample, we find that the host spectra for SN Ic-BL show lower average oxygen abundances than those for SN Ic. SN IIb host fiber spectra are also more metal-poor than those for SN Ib, although a significant difference exists for only one of two strong-line diagnostics. SN Ic-BL host galaxy emission lines show strong central specific SFRs. In contrast, we find no strong evidence for different environments for SN IIn compared to the sites of SN II. Because our SN sample is constructed from a variety of sources, there is always a risk that sampling methods can produce misleading results. We have separated the SN discovered by targeted surveys from those discovered by galaxy-impartial searches to examine these questions and show that our results do not depend sensitively on the discovery technique.},

abstract = {When the afterglow fades at the site of a long-duration gamma-ray burst (LGRB), Type Ic supernovae (SN Ic) are the only type of core collapse supernova observed. Recent work found that a sample of LGRB in high-redshift galaxies had different environments from a collection of core-collapse environments, which were identified from their colors and light curves. LGRB were in the brightest regions of their hosts, but the core-collapse sample followed the overall distribution of the galaxy light. Here we examine 504 supernovae with types assigned based on their spectra that are located in nearby (z < 0.06) galaxies for which we have constructed surface photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The distributions of the thermonuclear supernovae (SN Ia) and some varieties of core-collapse supernovae (SN II and SN Ib) follow the galaxy light, but the SN Ic (like LGRB) are much more likely to erupt in the brightest regions of their hosts. The high-redshift hosts of LGRB are overwhelmingly irregulars, without bulges, while many low redshift SN Ic hosts are spirals with small bulges. When we remove the bulge light from our low-redshift sample, the SN Ic and LGRB distributions agree extremely well. If both LGRB and SN Ic stem from very massive stars, then it seems plausible that the conditions necessary for forming SN Ic are also required for LGRB. Additional factors, including metallicity, may determine whether the stellar evolution of a massive star leads to a LGRB with an underlying broad-lined SN Ic, or simply a SN Ic without a gamma-ray burst.},

abstract = {We describe catalog-level simulations of Type Ia supernova (SN$\sim$Ia) light curves in the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program (DES-SN), and in low-redshift samples from the Center for Astrophysics (CfA) and the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP). These simulations are used to model biases from selection effects and light curve analysis, and to determine bias corrections for SN$\sim$Ia distance moduli that are used to measure cosmological parameters. To generate realistic light curves, the simulation uses a detailed SN$\sim$Ia model, incorporates information from observations (PSF, sky noise, zero point), and uses summary information (e.g., detection efficiency vs. signal to noise ratio) based on 10,000 fake SN light curves whose fluxes were overlaid on images and processed with our analysis pipelines. The quality of the simulation is illustrated by predicting distributions observed in the data. Averaging within redshift bins, we find distance modulus biases up to 0.05$\sim$mag over the redshift ranges of the low-z and DES-SN samples. For individual events, particularly those with extreme red or blue color, distance biases can reach 0.4$\sim$mag. Therefore, accurately determining bias corrections is critical for precision measurements of cosmological parameters. Files used to make these corrections are available at https://des.ncsa.illinois.edu/releases/sn.},

abstract = {We present measurements of the Hubble diagram for 103 Type Ia supernovae (SNe) with redshifts 0.04 < z < 0.42, discovered during the first season (Fall 2005) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II (SDSS-II) Supernova Survey. These data fill in the redshift "desert" between low- and high-redshift SN Ia surveys. Within the framework of the MLCS2K2 light-curve fitting method, we use the SDSS-II SN sample to infer the mean reddening parameter for host galaxies, R V = 2.18 0.14 stat 0.48 syst , and find that the intrinsic distribution of host-galaxy extinction is well fitted by an exponential function, P(A V ) = exp(-A V /$\tau$ V ), with $\tau$ V = 0.334 0.088 mag. We combine the SDSS-II measurements with new distance estimates for published SN data from the ESSENCE survey, the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS), the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and a compilation of Nearby SN Ia measurements. A new feature in our analysis is the use of detailed Monte Carlo simulations of all surveys to account for selection biases, including those from spectroscopic targeting. Combining the SN Hubble diagram with measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations from the SDSS Luminous Red Galaxy sample and with cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropy measurements from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, we estimate the cosmological parameters w and $\Omega$ M , assuming a spatially flat cosmological model (FwCDM) with constant dark energy equation of state parameter, w. We also consider constraints upon $\Omega$ M and $\Omega$ $\Lambda$ for a cosmological constant model ($\Lambda$CDM) with w = -1 and non-zero spatial curvature. For the FwCDM model and the combined sample of 288 SNe Ia, we find w = -0.76 0.07(stat) 0.11(syst), $\Omega$ M = 0.307 0.019(stat) 0.023(syst) using MLCS2K2 and w = -0.96 0.06(stat) 0.12(syst), $\Omega$ M = 0.265 0.016(stat) 0.025(syst) using the SALT-II fitter. We trace the discrepancy between these results to a difference in the rest-frame UV model combined with a different luminosity correction from color variations; these differences mostly affect the distance estimates for the SNLS and HST SNe. We present detailed discussions of systematic errors for both light-curve methods and find that they both show data-model discrepancies in rest-frame U band. For the SALT-II approach, we also see strong evidence for redshift-dependence of the color-luminosity parameter ($\beta$). Restricting the analysis to the 136 SNe Ia in the Nearby+SDSS-II samples, we find much better agreement between the two analysis methods but with larger uncertainties: w = -0.92 0.13(stat) +0.10 -0.33 (syst) for MLCS2K2 and w = -0.92 0.11(stat) +0.07 -0.15 (syst) for SALT-II. {\textcopyright} 2009.

abstract = {We have used a combination of stellar population synthesis and photoionization models to develop a set of ionization parameter and abundance diagnostics based only on the use of the strong optical emission lines. These models are applicable to both extragalactic HII regions and star-forming galaxies. We show that, because our techniques solve explicitly for both the ionization parameter and the chemical abundance, the diagnostics presented here are an improvement on earlier techniques based on strong emission-line ratios. Our techniques are applicable at all metallicities. In particular, for metallicities above half solar, the ratio [NII]/[OII] provides a very reliable diagnostic since it is ionization parameter independant and does not have a local maximum. This ratio has not been used historically because of worries about reddening corrections. However, we show that the use of classical reddening curves is quite sufficient to allow this [NII]/[OII] diagnostic to be used with confidence as a reliable abundance indicator. The cause of systematic and random errors inherent in previous techniques are discussed, and we present a new `optimal' abundance diagnostic method based on the use of line ratios involving [NII], [OII], [OIII], [SII] and the Balmer lines. This combined diagnostic appears to suffer no apparent systematic errors, can be used over the entire abundance range and significantly reduces the random error inherent in previous techniques. Finally, we give a recommended procedure for the derivation of abundances in the case that only spectra of limited wavelength coverage are available so that the optimal method can no longer be used.},

abstract = {(Abridged) We investigate the effect of metallicity calibrations, AGN classification, and aperture covering fraction on the local mass-metallicity (MZ) relation using 27,730 star-forming galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 4. We analyse the SDSS MZ relation with 10 metallicity calibrations, including theoretical and empirical methods. We show that the choice of metallicity calibration has a significant effect on the shape and y-intercept(12+log(O/H)) of the MZ relation. The absolute metallicity scale (y-int) varies up to 0.7 dex, depending on the calibration used, and the change in shape is substantial. These results indicate that it is critical to use the same metallicity calibration when comparing different luminosity-metallicity or mass-metallicity relations. We present new metallicity conversions that allow metallicities that have been derived using different strong-line calibrations to be converted to the same base calibration. These conversions facilitate comparisons between different samples, particularly comparisons between galaxies at different redshifts for which different suites of emission-lines are available.Our new conversions successfully remove the large 0.7 dex discrepancies between the metallicity calibrations, and we reach agreement in the MZ relation to within 0.03 dex on average. We find that different AGN classification methods have negligible effect on the SDSS MZ relation. We compare the SDSS MZ relation with nuclear and global relations from the Nearby Field Galaxy Survey (NFGS). The turn over of the MZ relation depends on aperture covering fraction. We find that a lower redshift limit of z<0.04 is insufficient for avoiding aperture effects in fiber spectra of the highest stellar mass galaxies.},

We show, for the first time, that while the [OIII]/Hb and [OIII]/[OII] ratios rise, the [NII]/H-alpha and [SII]/H-alpha ratios fall significantly over the 0.2<z<0.35 redshift range for stellar masses between 9.2<log(M/Msun)<10.6. The [OIII]/H-beta and [OIII]/[OII] ratios continue to rise across the full 0.2<z<0.6 redshift range for stellar masses between 9.8<log(M/Msun)<10.0. We conclusively rule out AGN contamination, a changing ISM pressure, and a change in the hardness of the EUV radiation field as the cause of the change in the line ratios between 0.2<z<0.35. We find that the ionization parameter rises significantly with redshift (by 0.1 to 0.25 dex depending on the stellar mass of the sample). We show that the ionization parameter is strongly correlated with the fraction of young-to-old stars, as traced by the H-beta equivalent width. We discuss the implications of this result on higher redshift studies, and we consider the implications on the use of standard optical metallicity diagnostics at high redshift.},

Correcting for this, we find that the implied SFR to beyond z = 8 is consistent with Lyman Break Galaxy-based measurements after accounting for unseen galaxies at the faint end of the UV luminosity function. We show that this provides support for the integrated star formation in the range 6 lsim z lsim 8 to have been alone sufficient to reionize the universe.},

This work uses the 6 degree Field Galaxy Survey and the Discrete Persistent Structures Extractor to define the filamentary structure of the local cosmic web. HI spectral stacking of HI Parkes all sky survey observations yields the HI fraction for filament galaxies and a field control sample. The HI fraction is measured for different stellar masses and fifth nearest neighbour projected densities ($\Sigma_{5}$) to disentangle what influences cold gas in galaxies. For galaxies with stellar masses log($M_{\star}$) $<$ 11 M$_{\odot}$ in projected densities 0 $\leq$ $\Sigma_{5}$ $<$ 3 galaxies Mpc$^{-2}$, all HI fractions of galaxies near filaments are statistically indistinguishable from the control sample. Galaxies with stellar masses log($M_{\star}$) $\geq$ 11 M$_{\odot}$ have a systematically higher HI fraction near filaments than the control sample. The greatest difference is 0.75 dex, which is 5.5$\sigma$ difference at mean projected densities of 1.45 galaxies Mpc$^{-2}$. We suggest that this is evidence for massive galaxies accreting cold gas from the intrafilament medium that can replenish some HI gas. This supports cold mode accretion where filament galaxies with a large gravitational potential can draw gas from the large-scale structure.},

abstract = {We report results from a comprehensive follow-up observing campaign of the afterglow of GRB 030226, including VLT spectroscopy, VLT polarimetry, and Chandra X-ray observations. In addition, we present BOOTES-1 wide-field observations at the time of the occurrence of the burst. First observations at ESO started 0.2 days after the event when the gamma ray burst (GRB) afterglow was at a magnitude of R ∼ 19 and continued until the afterglow had faded below the detection threshold (R  >  26). No underlying host galaxy was found. The optical light curve shows a break around 0.8 days after the burst, which is achromatic within the observational errors, supporting the view that it was due to a jetted explosion. Close to the break time the degree of linear polarization of the afterglow light was less than 1.1%, which favors a uniform-jet model rather than a structured one. VLT spectra show two absorption line systems at redshifts z = 1.962 ± 0.001 and 1.986 ± 0.001, placing the lower limit for the redshift of the GRB close to 2. We emphasize that the kinematics and the composition of the absorbing clouds responsible for these line systems are very similar to those observed in the afterglow of GRB 021004. This corroborates the picture in which at least some GRBs are physically related to the explosion of a Wolf-Rayet star.},

We present a phenomenological analysis by applying fireball closure relations, and interpret the findings in the context of the fireball model. We discuss the plausibility of a magnetar as a central engine, being responsible for additional and prolonged energy injection into the fireball. We find convincing evidence for energy injection into the afterglow of GRB 150424A. We find that a magnetar spin down as source for a prolonged energy injection requires that at least 4% of the spin-down energy is converted to radiation.},

The slope of the L-Z relation may evolve, in the sense that the least luminous galaxies at each redshift interval become increasingly metal-poor compared to more luminous galaxies.

We detected a compact H$\alpha$-emitting (i.e., star-forming) region in the galaxy, which has a much smaller angular size [$< 0".57$ (1.9 kpc) at full width at half maximum (FWHM)] than the extended stellar continuum emission region determined by the Gemini/GMOS z'-band image [$\simeq 1".4$ (4.6 kpc) at FWHM with ellipticity b/a=0.45]. The spatial offset between the centroid of the H$\alpha$ emission region and the position of the radio bursts is $0".08 \pm 0".02$ ($0.26 \pm 0.07$ kpc), indicating that FRB 121102 is located within the star-forming region. This close spatial association of FRB 121102 with the star-forming region is consistent with expectations from young pulsar/magnetar models for FRB 121102, and it also suggests that the observed H$\alpha$ emission region can make a major dispersion measure (DM) contribution to the host galaxy DM component of FRB 121102. Nevertheless, the largest possible value of the DM contribution from the H$\alpha$ emission region inferred from our observations still requires a significant amount of ionized baryons in intergalactic medium (the so-called `missing' baryons) as the DM source of FRB 121102, and we obtain a 90\% confidence level lower limit on the cosmic baryon density in the intergalactic medium in the low-redshift universe as $\Omega_{IGM} > 0.012$.},

abstract = {Several recent studies have shown that about half of the massive galaxies at z ∼ 2 are in a quiescent phase. Moreover, these galaxies are commonly found to be ultra-compact with half-light radii of ∼ 1 kpc. We have obtained a ∼ 29 hr spectrum of a typical quiescent, ultra-dense galaxy at z = 2.1865 with the Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph. The spectrum exhibits a strong optical break and several absorption features, which have not previously been detected in z > 2 quiescent galaxies. Comparison of the spectral energy distribution with stellar population synthesis models implies a low star formation rate (SFR) of 1-3 M⊙ yr-1, an age of 1.3-2.2 Gyr, and a stellar mass of ∼ 2 × 1011 M⊙. We detect several faint emission lines, with emission-line ratios of [N II]/H$\alpha$, [S II]/H$\alpha$, and [O II]/[O III] typical of low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions. Thus, neither the stellar continuum nor the nebular emission implies active star formation. The current SFR is < 1% of the past average SFR. If this galaxy is representative of compact quiescent galaxies beyond z = 2, it implies that quenching of star formation is extremely efficient and also indicates that low luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) could be common in these objects. Nuclear emission is a potential concern for the size measurement. However, we show that the AGN contributes ≲ 8% to the rest-frame optical emission. A possible post-starburst population may affect size measurements more strongly; although a 0.5 Gyr old stellar population can make up ≲ 10% of the total stellar mass, it could account for up to ∼ 40% of the optical light. Nevertheless, this spectrum shows that this compact galaxy is dominated by an evolved stellar population.},

abstract = {We present the results of a new spectroscopic survey for dusty intervening absorption systems, particularly damped Ly$\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs), towards reddened quasars. The candidate quasars are selected from mid-infrared photometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer combined with optical and near-infrared photometry. Out of 1073 candidates, we secure low-resolution spectra for 108 using the Nordic Optical Telescope on La Palma, Spain. Based on the spectra, we are able to classify 100 of the 108 targets as quasars. A large fraction (50 %) is observed to have broad absorption lines (BALs). Moreover, we find 6 quasars with strange breaks in their spectra, which are not consistent with regular dust reddening. Using template fitting we infer the amount of reddening along each line of sight ranging from A(V)$\approx$0.1 mag to 1.2 mag (assuming an SMC extinction curve). In four cases, the reddening is consistent with dust exhibiting the 2175{\AA} feature caused by an intervening absorber, and for two of these, a MgII absorption system is observed at the best-fit absorption redshift. In the rest of the cases, the reddening is most likely intrinsic to the quasar. We observe no evidence for dusty DLAs in this survey. However, the large fraction of BAL quasars hampers the detection of absorption systems. Out of the 50 non-BAL quasars only 28 have sufficiently high redshift to detect Ly$\alpha$ in absorption.},

abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of a red quasar at z=2.32 with an intervening damped Lyman-alpha absorber (DLA) at z=2.13. Using high quality data from the X-shooter spectrograph at ESO Very Large Telescope we find that the absorber has a metallicity consistent with Solar. We observe strong C I and H$_2$ absorption indicating a cold, dense absorbing medium. Partial coverage effects are observed in the C I lines, from which we infer a covering fraction of $27 \pm 6$ % and a physical diameter of the cloud of 0.1 pc. From the covering fraction and size, we estimate the size of the background quasar's broad line region. We search for emission from the DLA counterpart in optical and near-infrared imaging. No emission is observed in the optical data. However, we see tentative evidence for a counterpart in the H and K' band images. The DLA shows high depletion (as probed by [Fe/Zn]=-1.22) indicating that significant amounts of dust must be present in the DLA. By fitting the spectrum with various dust reddened quasar templates we find a best-fitting amount of dust in the DLA of $A(V)_{\rm DLA}=0.28 \pm 0.01|_{\rm stat} \pm 0.07|_{\rm sys}$. We conclude that dust in the DLA is causing the colours of this intrinsically very luminous background quasar to appear much redder than average quasars, thereby not fulfilling the criteria for quasar identification in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Such chemically enriched and dusty absorbers are thus underrepresented in current samples of DLAs.},

abstract = {Quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) whose spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are reddened by dust either in their host galaxies or in intervening absorber galaxies are to a large degree missed by optical color selection criteria like the one used by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). To overcome this bias against red QSOs, we employ a combined optical and near-infrared color selection. In this paper, we present a spectroscopic follow-up campaign of a sample of red candidate QSOs which were selected from the SDSS and the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS). The spectroscopic data and SDSS/UKIDSS photometry are supplemented by mid-infrared photometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. In our sample of 159 candidates, 154 (97%) are confirmed to be QSOs. We use a statistical algorithm to identify sightlines with plausible intervening absorption systems and identify nine such cases assuming dust in the absorber similar to Large Magellanic Cloud sightlines. We find absorption systems toward 30 QSOs, 2 of which are consistent with the best-fit absorber redshift from the statistical modeling. Furthermore, we observe a broad range in SED properties of the QSOs as probed by the rest-frame 2 {\mu}m flux. We find QSOs with a strong excess as well as QSOs with a large deficit at rest-frame 2 {\mu}m relative to a QSO template. Potential solutions to these discrepancies are discussed. Overall, our study demonstrates the high efficiency of the optical/near-infrared selection of red QSOs.},

abstract = {Starting from a summary of detection statistics of our recent X-shooter campaign, we review the major surveys, both space and ground based, for emission counterparts of high-redshift damped Ly$\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs) carried out since the first detection 25 years ago. We show that the detection rates of all surveys are precisely reproduced by a simple model in which the metallicity and luminosity of the galaxy associated to the DLA follow a relation of the form, M UV = −5 × ([M/H] + 0.3) − 20.8, and the DLA cross-section follows a relation of the form $\sigma$ DLA ∝ L 0.8 . Specifically, our spectroscopic campaign consists of 11 DLAs preselected based on their equivalent width of Si II $\lambda$1526 to have a metallicity higher than [Si/H] > −1. The targets have been observed with the X-shooter spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope to search for emission lines around the quasars. We observe a high detection rate of 64% (7/11), significantly higher than the typical ∼10% for random, H I-selected DLA samples. We use the aforementioned model, to simulate the results of our survey together with a range of previous surveys: spectral stacking, direct imaging (using the 'double DLA' technique), long-slit spectroscopy, and integral field spectroscopy. Based on our model results, we are able to reconcile all results. Some tension is observed between model and data when looking at predictions of Ly$\alpha$ emission for individual targets. However, the object to object variations are most likely a result of the significant scatter in the underlying scaling relations as well as uncertainties in the amount of dust which affects the emission.},

We present the results of extensive analyses of the stellar continuum covering the rest frame optical-UV regime based on broad-band HST imaging, and of spectroscopy from VLT/X-Shooter of the strong emission lines: Ly-alpha, [OII], [OIII], [NII], H-alpha and H-beta. We compare the metallicity from the absorption lines in the QSO spectrum with the oxygen abundance inferred from the strong-line methods (R23 and N2). The two emission-line methods yield consistent results: [O/H] = -0.30+/-0.13. Based on the absorption lines in the QSO spectrum a metallicity of -0.49+/-0.05 is inferred at an impact parameter of 6.3 kpc from the centre of the galaxy with a column density of hydrogen of log(N_HI)=20.65+/-0.05. The star formation rates of the galaxy from the UV continuum and H-alpha line can be reconciled assuming an amount of reddening of E(B-V) = 0.06+/-0.01, giving an inferred SFR of 13+/-1 M_sun / yr (assuming a Chabrier IMF). From the HST imaging, the galaxy associated with the absorption is found to be a compact (re=1.12 kpc) object with a disc-like, elongated (axis ratio 0.17) structure indicating that the galaxy is seen close to edge on. Moreover, the absorbing gas is located almost perpendicularly above the disc of the galaxy suggesting that the gas causing the absorption is not co-rotating with the disc. We investigate the stellar and dynamical masses from SED-fitting and emission-line widths, respectively, and find consistent results of 2x10^9 M_sun. We suggest that the galaxy is a young proto-disc with evidence for a galactic outflow of enriched gas. This galaxy hints at how star-forming galaxies may be linked to the elusive population of damped Lyman-alpha absorbers.},

abstract = {A universal initial mass function (IMF) is not intuitive, but so far no convincing evidence for a variable IMF exists. The detection of systematic variations of the IMF with star-forming conditions would be the Rosetta Stone for star formation. In this contribution an average or Galactic-field IMF is defined, stressing that there is evidence for a change in the power-law index at only two masses: near 0.5 M⊙ and near 0.08 M⊙. Using this supposed universal IMF, the uncertainty inherent in any observational estimate of the IMF is investigated by studying the scatter introduced by Poisson noise and the dynamical evolution of star clusters. It is found that this apparent scatter reproduces quite well the observed scatter in power-law index determinations, thus defining the fundamental limit within which any true variation becomes undetectable. The absence of evidence for a variable IMF means that any true variation of the IMF in well-studied populations must be smaller than this scatter. Determinations of the power-law indices $\alpha$ are subject to systematic errors arising mostly from unresolved binaries. The systematic bias is quantified here, with the result that the single-star IMFs for young star clusters are systematically steeper by $\Delta$$\alpha$ ≈ 0.5 between 0.1 and 1 M⊙ than the Galactic-field IMF, which is populated by, on average, about 5-Gyr-old stars. The MFs in globular clusters appear to be, on average, systematically flatter than the Galactic-field IMF (Piotto & Zoccali; Paresce & De Marchi), and the recent detection of ancient white-dwarf candidates in the Galactic halo and the absence of associated low-mass stars (Ibata et al.; M{\'{e}}ndez & Minniti) suggest a radically different IMF for this ancient population. Star formation in higher metallicity environments thus appears to produce relatively more low-mass stars. While still tentative, this is an interesting trend, being consistent with a systematic variation of the IMF as expected from theoretical arguments.},

abstract = {Context. The afterglows and host galaxies of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) offer unique opportunities to study star-forming galaxies in the high-z Universe. Until recently, however, the information inferred from GRB follow-up observations was mostly limited to optically bright afterglows, biasing all demographic studies against sight-lines that contain large amounts of dust. Aims: Here we present afterglow and host observations for a sample of bursts that are exemplary of previously missed ones because of high visual extinction (A_{V}^{GRB} {\gsim} 1 mag) along the sight-line. This facilitates an investigation of the properties, geometry, and location of the absorbing dust of these poorly-explored host galaxies, and a comparison to hosts from optically-selected samples. Methods: This work is based on GROND optical/NIR and Swift/XRT X-ray observations of the afterglows, and multi-color imaging for eight GRB hosts. The afterglow and galaxy spectral energy distributions yield detailed insight into physical properties such as the dust and metal content along the GRB sight-line and galaxy-integrated characteristics such as the host's stellar mass, luminosity, color-excess, and star-formation rate. Results: For the eight afterglows considered in this study, we report for the first time the redshift of GRB 081109 (z = 0.9787 {\plusmn} 0.0005), and the visual extinction towards GRBs 081109 (A_{V}^{GRB} = 3.4_{-0.3}^{+0.4} mag) and 100621A (A_{V}^{GRB} = 3.8{\plusmn}0.2 mag), which are among the largest ever derived for GRB afterglows. Combined with non-extinguished GRBs, there is a strong anti-correlation between the afterglow's metal-to-dust ratio and visual extinction. The hosts of the dustiest afterglows are diverse in their properties, but on average redder ({\mlab} (R - K)_{AB} {\mrab} $\sim$ 1.6 mag), more luminous ({\mlab} L {\mrab} $\sim$ 0.9 L^{∗}), and massive ({\mlab} log M_{∗} [M_{⊙}] {\mrab} $\sim$ 9.8) than the hosts of optically-bright events. Hence, we probe a different galaxy population, suggesting that previous host samples miss most of the massive and metal-rich members. This also indicates that the dust along the sight-line is often related to host properties, and thus probably located in the diffuse ISM or interstellar clouds and not in the immediate GRB environment. Some of the hosts in our sample, are blue, young, or of low stellar mass illustrating that even apparently non-extinguished galaxies possess very dusty sight-lines owing to a patchy dust distribution. Conclusions: The afterglows and host galaxies of the dustiest GRBs provide evidence of a complex dust geometry in star-forming galaxies. In addition, they establish a population of luminous, massive, and correspondingly chemically evolved GRB hosts. This suggests that GRBs trace the global star-formation rate better than studies based on optically selected host samples indicate, and that the previously claimed deficiency of high-mass hosts was at least partially a selection effect.

abstract = {Spatially-resolved spectroscopy of the environments of explosive transients carries detailed information about the physical properties of the stellar population that gave rise to the explosion, and thus the progenitor itself. Here, we present new observations of ESO184-G82, the galaxy hosting the archetype of the $\gamma$-ray burst/supernova connection, GRB 980425/SN 1998bw, obtained with the integral-field spectrograph MUSE at the VLT. These observations yield detailed maps of emission-line strength for various nebular lines, as well as physical parameters like dust extinction, stellar age, and oxygen abundance on spatial scales of 160 pc. The immediate environment of GRB 980425 is young (5 – 8 Myr) and consistent with a mildly-extinguished (A V ∼ 0.1 mag) progenitor of zero-age main-sequence mass between 25 M and 40 M and oxygen abundance 12 + log(O/H) ∼ 8.2 (Z ∼ 0.3 Z). This metallicity is slightly lower than the one of an integrated measurement of the whole galaxy (12 + log(O/H) ∼ 8.3) and a prominent nearby H ii-region (12 + log(O/H) ∼ 8.4). This Wolf-Rayet region is significantly younger than the explosion site, and we argue that a scenario in which the GRB progenitor formed there and was subsequently ejected appears very unlikely. We show that empirical strong-line methods based on [O iii] and/or [N ii] are inadequate to produce accurate maps of oxygen abundance at the level of detail of our MUSE observation as these methods over-/underestimate 12 + log(O/H) at low/high ionization parameter. The metallicity gradient in ESO184-G82 is -0.06 dex kpc −1 , indicating that the typical offsets of at most few kpc for cosmological GRBs have a small impact for high-redshift measurements on average. Similarly, the GRB/SN site spectrum returns broadly comparable physical parameters to those inferred from an unresolved spectrum, which is typically obtained for high-redshift galaxies.},

Follow-up observations in g′r′i′z′ and JHK s  bands started at ∼17 minutes and extended up to 28 hr postburst. We find an increase in the brightness of the afterglow at early times, which can be explained by the superposition of reverse and forward shock (FS) emission or the onset of the afterglow FS. In addition, we detect a strong broadband absorption feature in the i′ band, which we interpret as extinction from the redshifted 2175 {\AA}bump in the GRB host galaxy. This is one of the first and clearest detections of the 2175 {\AA}feature at high redshift.

abstract = {[Abridged] We present data and initial results from VLT/X-Shooter emission-line spectroscopy of 96 GRB-selected galaxies at 0.1<z<3.6, the largest sample of GRB host spectroscopy available to date. Most of our GRBs were detected by Swift and 76% are at 0.5<z<2.5 with a median z$\sim$1.6. Based on Balmer and/or forbidden lines of oxygen, nitrogen, and neon, we measure systemic redshifts, star formation rates (SFRs), visual attenuations, oxygen abundances (12+log(O/H)), and emission-line widths. We find a strong change of the typical physical properties of GRB hosts with redshift. The median SFR, for example, increases from $\sim$0.6 M_sun/yr at z$\sim$0.6 up to $\sim$15 M_sun/yr at z$\sim$2. A higher ratio of [OIII]/[OII] at higher redshifts leads to an increasing distance of GRB-selected galaxies to the locus of local galaxies in the BPT diagram. Oxygen abundances of the galaxies are distributed between 12+log(O/H)=7.9 and 12+log(O/H)=9.0 with a median of 12+log(O/H)$\sim$8.5. The fraction of GRB-selected galaxies with super-solar metallicities is around 20% at z<1 in the adopted metallicity scale. This is significantly less than the fraction of star formation in similar galaxies, illustrating that GRBs are scarce in high-metallicity environments. At z$\sim$3, sensitivity limits us to probing only the most luminous GRB hosts for which we derive metallicities of Z $\sim$< 0.5 Z_sun. Together with a high incidence of galaxies with similar metallicity in our sample at z$\sim$1.5, this indicates that the metallicity dependence observed at low redshift will not be dominant at z$\sim$3.},

abstract = {We argue that the lack of observed damped Ly$\alpha$ (DLA) systems that simultaneously have high H I column densities and high metallicities results naturally from the formation of molecules in the cold phase of a two-phase atomic medium in pressure balance. Our result applies equally well in diffuse systems where the ultraviolet radiation field is dominated by the extragalactic background and in dense star-forming ones, where the local radiation field is likely to be orders of magnitude higher. We point out that such a radiation-insensitive model is required to explain the absence of high column-high metallicity systems among DLAs observed using gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows, since these are likely subjected to strong radiation fields created by active star formation in the GRB host galaxy. Moreover, we show that the observed relationship between the maximum atomic gas column in DLAs sets a firm upper limit on the fraction of the mass in these systems that can be in the warm, diffuse phase. Finally, we argue that our result explains the observed lack of in situ star formation in DLA systems.},

abstract = {The bright transient AT2018cow has been unlike any other known type of transient. Its high brightness, rapid rise and decay, and initially nearly featureless spectrum are unprecedented and difficult to explain using models for similar burst sources. We present evidence for faint $\gamma$-ray emission continuing for at least 8 d, and featureless spectra in the ultraviolet bands - both unusual for eruptive sources. The X-ray variability of the source has a burst-like character. The UV-optical spectrum does not show any CNO line but is well described by a blackbody. We demonstrate that a model invoking the tidal disruption of a 0.1-0.4M⊙ helium white dwarf (WD) by a 105-106M⊙ black hole located in the outskirts of galaxy Z 137-068 could provide an explanation for most of the characteristics shown in the multiwavelength observations. A blackbody-like emission is emitted from an opaque photosphere, formed by the debris of the WD disruption. Broad features showing up in the optical/infrared spectra in the early stage are probably velocity broadened lines produced in a transient high-velocity outward moving cocoon. The asymmetric optical/infrared lines that appeared at a later stage are emission from an atmospheric layer when it detached from thermal equilibrium with the photosphere, which undergoes more rapid cooling. The photosphere shrinks when its temperature drops, and the subsequent infall of the atmosphere produced asymmetric line profiles. Additionally, a non-thermal jet might be present, emitting X-rays in the 10-150 keV band.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of the luminosity distances of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II (SDSS-II) SN Survey in conjunction with other intermediate-redshift (z < 0.4) cosmological measurements including redshift-space distortions from the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS), the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect seen by the SDSS and the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) distance scale from both the SDSS and 2dFGRS. We have analysed the SDSS-II SN data alone using a variety of 'model-independent' methods and find evidence for an accelerating Universe at a >97 per cent level from this single data set. We find good agreement between the SN and BAO distance measurements, both consistent with a $\Lambda$-dominated cold dark matter cosmology, as demonstrated through an analysis of the distance duality relationship between the luminosity (dL) and angular diameter (dA) distance measures. We then use these data to estimate w within this restricted redshift range (z < 0.4). Our most stringent result comes from the combination of all our intermediate-redshift data (SDSS-II SNe, BAO, ISW and redshift-space distortions), giving w = -0.81+0.16-0.18 (stat) ± 0.15 (sys) and $\Omega$M = 0.22 +0.09-0.08 assuming a flat universe. This value of w and associated errors only change slightly if curvature is allowed to vary, consistent with constraints from the cosmic microwave background. We also consider more limited combinations of the geometrical (SN, BAO) and dynamical (ISW, redshift-space distortions) probes. {\textcopyright} 2009 RAS.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of the host galaxy dependences of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) from the full three year sample of the SDSS-II Supernova Survey.We re-discover, to high significance, the strong correlation between host galaxy type and the width of the observed SN light curve, i.e., fainter, quickly declining SNe Ia favor passive host galaxies, while brighter, slowly declining Ia's favor star-forming galaxies. We also find evidence (at between 2$\sigma$ and 3$\sigma$) that SNe Ia are $\sigma$ 0.1 ± 0.04 mag brighter in passive host galaxies than in star-forming hosts, after the SN Ia light curves have been standardized using the light-curve shape and color variations. This difference in brightness is present in both the SALT2 and MCLS2k2 light-curve fitting methodologies. We see evidence for differences in the SN Ia color relationship between passive and star-forming host galaxies, e.g., for the MLCS2k2 technique, we see that SNe Ia in passive hosts favor a dust law of RV = 1.0 ± 0.2, while SNe Ia in star-forming hosts require RV = 1.8+0.2-0.4. The significance of these trends depends on the range of SN colors considered. We demonstrate that these effects can be parameterized using the stellar mass of the host galaxy (with a confidence of >4$\sigma$) and including this extra parameter provides a better statistical fit to our data. Our results suggest that future cosmological analyses of SN Ia samples should include host galaxy information. {\textcopyright} 2010. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Calibration uncertainties have been the leading systematic uncertainty in recent analyses using type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) to measure cosmological parameters. To improve the calibration, we present the application of Spectral Energy Distribution (SED)-dependent "chromatic corrections" to the supernova light-curve photometry from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). These corrections depend on the combined atmospheric and instrumental transmission function for each exposure, and they affect photometry at the 0.01 mag (1%) level, comparable to systematic uncertainties in calibration and photometry. Fitting our combined DES and low-z SN Ia sample with Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) priors for the cosmological parameters $\Omega_{\rm m}$ (the fraction of the critical density of the universe comprised of matter) and w (the dark energy equation of state parameter), we compare those parameters before and after applying the corrections. We find the change in w and $\Omega_{\rm m}$ due to not including chromatic corrections are -0.002 and 0.000, respectively, for the DES-SN3YR sample with BAO and CMB priors, consistent with a larger DES-SN3YR-like simulation, which has a w-change of 0.0005 with an uncertainty of 0.008 and an $\Omega_{\rm m}$ change of 0.000 with an uncertainty of 0.002 . However, when considering samples on individual CCDs we find large redshift-dependent biases (approximately 0.02 in distance modulus) for supernova distances.},

abstract = {High resolution spectroscopy of GRB 021004 revealed a wealth of absorption lines from several intermediate ionization species. The velocity structure of the absorber is complex and material with velocity up to >3000 km/s is observed. Since only the blueshifted component is observed, the absorber is very likely to be material closely surrounding the gamma-ray burst. We use a time-dependent photoionization code to track the abundance of the ions over time. Thanks to the presence of absorption from intermediate ionization states at long times, we can estimate the location and mass of the components of the absorber. We interpret those constraints within the hypernova scenario showing that the mass loss rate of the progenitor must have been $\sim$10^{-4} solar masses per year, suggestive of a very massive star. In addition, the wind termination shock must lie at a distance of at least 100 pc, implying a low density environment. The velocity structure of the absorber also requires clumping of the wind at those large distances.},

abstract = {Photometric redshifts are estimated on the basis of template scenarios with the help of the code Z-PEG, an extension of the galaxy evolution model P{\'{E}}GASE.2 and available on the P{\'{E}}GASE web site. The spectral energy distribution (SED) templates are computed for nine spectral types including starburst, irregular, spiral and elliptical. Dust, extinction and metal effects are coherently taken into account, depending on evolution scenarios. The sensitivity of results to adding near-infrared colors and IGM absorption is analyzed. A comparison with results of other models without evolution measures the evolution factor which systematically increases the estimated photometric redshift values by $\Delta$z ≥ 0.2 for z > 1.5. Moreover we systematically check that the evolution scenarios match observational standard templates of nearby galaxies, implying an age constraint of the stellar population at z = 0 for each type. The respect of this constraint makes it possible to significantly improve the accuracy of photometric redshifts by decreasing the well-known degeneracy problem. The method is applied to the HDF-N sample (see in Fern{\'{a}}ndez-Soto et al. 1999). From fits on SED templates by a x2-minimization procedure, not only is the photometric redshift derived but also the corresponding spectral type and the formation redshift zfor when stars first formed. Early epochs of galaxy formation zfor > 5 are found from this new method and results are compared to faint galaxy count interpretations. The new tool is available at: http://www.iap.fr/pegase.},

Our sample is derived from GRBs that were identified with subarcsecond localization between 1997 and 2001, and only a very small fraction (∼20%) of the targeted sources are detected down tof 4.5$\mu$m ∼ 3.5 $\mu$Jy and F24$\mu$m ∼ 85 $\mu$Ju (3 $\sigma$). This likely argues against a population dominated by massive and strongly starbursting (i.e., SFR ≳ 100 M⊙ yr-1) galaxies as has been recently suggested from submillimeter/radio and optical studies of similarly selected GRB hosts. Further-more, we find evidence that some GRBs do not occur in the most infrared luminous regions - hence the most actively star-forming environments - of their host galaxies. Should the GRB hosts be representative of all star-forming galaxies at high redshift, models of infrared galaxy evolution indicate that ≳50% of GRB hosts should have f24 $\mu$m ≳ 100 $\mu$Jy. Unless the identification of GRBs prior to 2001 was prone to strong selection effects biasing our sample against dusty galaxies, we infer in this context that the GRBs identified with the current techniques cannot be directly used as unbiased probes of the global and integrated star formation history of the universe. {\textcopyright} 2006.

abstract = {We present the results of a search for cold gas at high redshift along QSO lines-of-sight carried out without any a priori assumption on the neutral atomic-hydrogen (HI) content of the absorbers. To do this, we systematically looked for neutral-carbon (CI) 1560,1656 transition lines in low-resolution QSO spectra from the SDSS database. We built up a sample of 66 CI absorbers with redshifts 1.5<z<3.1 and equivalent widths 0.1<W_r(1560)<1.7 A. The completeness limit of our survey is W_r,lim(1560)$\sim$0.4 A. CI systems stronger than that are more than one hundred-times rarer than DLAs at z_abs=2.5. The number of CI systems per unit redshift increases significantly below z=2. We suggest that the CI absorbers are closely related to the process of star formation and the production of dust in galaxies. We derive the HI content of the CI systems and find that a majority of them are sub-DLAs with N(HI)$\sim$10^20 atoms cm^-2. The dust content of these absorbers is yet significant as seen from the redder optical colours of the background QSOs and their reddened SEDs. The overall N(HI) distribution of CI systems is relatively flat however. As a consequence, among the CI systems classifying as DLAs there is a probable excess of strong DLAs with log N(HI)>21 compared to systematic DLA surveys. We study empirical relations between W_r(CI), N(HI), E(B-V) and the strength of the 2175 A extinction feature, the latter being detected in about 30% of the CI absorbers. We show that the 2175 A feature is weak compared to Galactic lines-of-sight exhibiting the same amount of reddening. This is probably the consequence of current or past star formation in the vicinity of the CI systems. We also find that the strongest CI systems tend to have the largest amounts of dust and that the metallicity of the gas and its molecular fraction is likely to be high in a large number of cases.},

abstract = {We used our database of VLT-UVES quasar spectra to build up a sample of 70 Damped Lyman-$\alpha$ (DLA) or strong sub-DLA systems with total neutral hydrogen column densities of log N(H i)⪆ 20 and redshifts in the range 1.7<z_abs<4.3. For each of the systems, we measured the metallicities relative to solar in an homogeneous manner, [X/H] (with X=Zn, or S or Si), and the velocity widths of low-ionization line profiles, $\Delta$ V. For the first time, we provide evidence for a correlation between DLA metallicity and line profile velocity width, which is detected at the 6.1$\sigma$ significance level. This confirms the trend previously observed in a much smaller sample by Wolfe & Prochaska (1998). The best-fit linear relation is [X/H]=1.55(± 0.12)log$\Delta$ V -4.33(± 0.23), with $\Delta$ V expressed in km s-1. The slope of the DLA velocity-metallicity relation is the same within uncertainties between the higher (z_abs>2.43) and the lower (z_abs≤ 2.43) redshift halves of our sample. However, the two populations of systems are statistically different. There is a strong redshift evolution in the sense that the median metallicity <sl>and</sl> median velocity width increase with decreasing redshift. We argue that the existence of a DLA velocity-metallicity correlation, over more than a factor of 100 spread in metallicity, is probably the consequence of an underlying mass-metallicity relation for the galaxies responsible for DLA absorption lines. Assuming a simple linear scaling of the galaxy luminosity with the mass of the dark-matter halo, we find that the slope of the DLA velocity-metallicity relation is consistent with that of the luminosity-metallicity relation derived for local galaxies. If the galaxy dynamical mass is indeed the dominant factor setting up the observed DLA velocity-metallicity correlation, then the DLA systems exhibiting the lowest metallicities among the DLA population should, on average, be associated with galaxies of lower masses (e.g., gas-rich dwarf galaxies). In turn, these galaxies should have the lowest luminosities among the DLA galaxy population. This could explain the difficulties of detecting high-redshift DLA galaxies in emission.},

abstract = {We present a direct detection of molecular hydrogen at the highest redshift known today (zabs=4.224) in a damped Ly$\alpha$ (DLA) system toward the quasar PSS J1443+2724. This absorber is remarkable for having one of the highest metallicities among DLA systems at zabs>3, with a measured iron abundance relative to solar of -1.12+/-0.10. We provide for the first time in this system accurate measurements of N I, Mg II, S II, and Ar I column densities. The sulfur and nitrogen abundances relative to solar, -0.63+/-0.10 and -1.38+/-0.10, respectively, correspond exactly to the primary nitrogen production plateau. H2 absorption lines are detected in four different rotational levels (J=0, 1, 2, and 3) of the vibrational ground state in three velocity components with total column densities logN(H2) of 17.67, 17.97, 17.48, and 17.26, respectively. The J=4 level is tentatively detected in the strongest component, with logN(H2)$\sim$14. The mean molecular fraction is logf=-2.38+/-0.13, with f=2N(H2)/[2N(H2)+N(H I)]. We also measure log[N(HD)/N(H2)]<-4.2. The excitation temperatures T01 for the two main components of the system are 96 K and 136 K, respectively. We argue that the absorbing galaxy, whose star formation activity must have started at least (2-5)×108 yr before z=4.224, is in a quiescent state at the time of observation. The density of the gas is low, nH<=50 cm-3, and the temperature is of the order of T$\sim$90-180 K. The high excitation of neutral carbon in one of the components can be explained if the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation has the value expected at the absorber redshift, T=14.2 K. These observations demonstrate the feasibility of studying H2 at the highest redshifts, provided high enough spectral resolution and good signal-to-noise ratio are achieved.},

abstract = {We aim to understand the nature of the absorbing neutral gas in the galaxies hosting high-redshift long-duration GRBs and to determine their physical conditions. We report the detection of a significant number of previously unidentified allowed transition lines of Fe+, involving the fine structure of the ground term and that of other excited levels, from the zabs=3.969, log N(H0)=22.10 DLA system located in the host galaxy of GRB 050730. The time-dependent evolution of the observed Fe+ energy-level populations is modelled by assuming the excitation mechanism is fluorescence following excitation by ultraviolet photons. This UV pumping model successfully reproduces the observations, yielding a burst/cloud distance (defined to the near-side of the cloud) of d=440\pm 30 pc and a linear cloud size of l=520{+240}{-190} pc. We discuss these results in the context of no detections of H2 and CI lines in a sample of seven z>1.8 GRB host galaxies observed with VLT/UVES. We show that the lack of H2 can be explained by the low metallicities, [X/H]<-1, low depletion factors and, at most, moderate particle densities of the systems. This points to a picture where GRB-DLAs typically exhibiting very high H0 column densities are diffuse metal-poor atomic clouds with high kinetic temperatures, Tkin>$\sim$1000 K, and large physical extents, l>$\sim$100 pc. The properties of GRB-DLAs observed at high spectral resolution towards bright GRB afterglows differ markedly from the high metal and dust contents of GRB-DLAs observed at lower resolution. This difference likely results from the effect of a bias, against systems of high metallicity and/or close to the GRB, due to dust obscuration in the magnitude-limited GRB afterglow samples observed with high-resolution spectrographs.},

abstract = {In cosmological simulations, a large fraction of the partial Lyman limit systems (pLLSs; 16<log N(HI)<17.2) and LLSs (17.2log N(HI)<19) probes large-scale flows in and out of galaxies through their circumgalactic medium (CGM). The overall low metallicity of the cold gaseous streams feeding galaxies seen in these simulations is the key to differentiating them from metal rich gas that is either outflowing or being recycled. In recent years, several groups have empirically determined an entirely new wealth of information on the pLLSs and LLSs over a wide range of redshifts. A major focus of the recent research has been to empirically determine the metallicity distribution of the gas probed by pLLSs and LLSs in sizable and representative samples at both low (z<1) and high (z>2) redshifts. Here I discuss unambiguous evidence for metal-poor gas at all z probed by the pLLSs and LLSs. At z<1, all the pLLSs and LLSs so far studied are located in the CGM of galaxies with projected distances <100-200 kpc. Regardless of the exact origin of the low-metallicity pLLSs/LLSs, there is a significant mass of cool, dense, low-metallicity gas in the CGM that may be available as fuel for continuing star formation in galaxies over cosmic time. As such, the metal-poor pLLSs and LLSs are currently among the best observational evidence of cold, metal-poor gas accretion onto galaxies.},

abstract = {We present the first results from our KODIAQ Z survey aimed to determine the metallicity distribution and physical properties of the z>2 partial and full Lyman limit systems (pLLSs and LLSs; 16.2<log N(HI)<19), which are probed of the interface regions between the intergalactic medium (IGM) and galaxies. We study 31 HI-selected pLLSs and LLSs at 2.3<z<3.3 observed with Keck/HIRES in absorption against background QSOs. We compare the column densities of metal-ions to HI and use photoionization models to assess the metallicity. The metallicity distribution of the pLLSs/LLSs at 2.3<z<3.3 is consistent with a unimodal distribution peaking at [X/H]=-2. The metallicity distribution of these absorbers therefore evolves markedly with z since at z<1 it is bimodal with peaks at [X/H]=-1.8 and -0.3. There is a substantial fraction (25-41%) of pLLSs/LLSs with metallicities well below those of damped Lya absorbers (DLAs) at any studied z from z<1 to z$\sim$2-4, implying reservoirs of metal-poor cool, dense gas in the IGM/galaxy interface at all z. However, the gas probed by pLLSs and LLSs is rarely pristine, with a fraction 3-18% for pLLSs/LLSs with [X/H]<-3. We find C/alpha enhancement in several pLLSs and LLSs in the metallicity range -2<[X/H]<-0.5, where C/alpha is 2-5 times larger than observed in Galactic metal-poor stars or high redshift DLAs at similar metallicities. This is likely caused by preferential ejection of carbon from metal-poor galaxies into their surroundings.},

abstract = {Aims. We study a thermonuclear supernova (SN), emphasizing very late phases. Methods. An extensive dataset for SN 2003hv that covers the flux evolution from maximum light to day +786 is presented. This includes 82 epochs of optical imaging, 24 epochs of near-infrared (NIR) imaging, and 10 epochs of optical spectroscopy. These data are combined with published nebular-phase IR spectra, and the observations are compared to model light curves and synthetic nebular spectra. Results. SN 2003hv is a normal Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) with photometric and spectroscopic properties consistent with its rarely observed B-band decline-rate parameter, $\Delta$m 15 (B) = 1.61 ± 0.02. The blueshift of the most isolated [Fe ii] lines in the nebular-phase optical spectrum appears consistent with those observed in the IR at similar epochs. At late times there is a prevalent color evolution from the optical toward the NIR bands. We present the latest-ever detection of a SN Ia in the NIR in Hubble Space Telescope images. The study of the ultraviolet/optical/infrared (UVOIR) light curve reveals that a substantial fraction of the flux is "missing" at late times. Between 300 and 700 days past maximum brightness, the UVOIR light curve declines linearly following the decay of radioactive 56 Co, assuming full and instantaneous positron trapping. At 700 days we detect a possible slowdown of the decline in optical-bands, mainly in the V-band. Conclusions. The data are incompatible with a dramatic infrared catastrophe (IRC). However, the idea that an IRC occurred in the densest regions before 350 days can explain the missing flux from the UVOIR wavelengths and the flat-topped profiles in the NIR. We argue that such a scenario is possible if the ejecta are clumpy. The observations suggest that positrons are most likely trapped in the ejecta.},

abstract = {When a star passes within the tidal radius of a supermassive black hole, it will be torn apart. For a star with the mass of the Sun ($M_\odot$) and a non-spinning black hole with a mass $<10^8 M_\odot$, the tidal radius lies outside the black hole event horizon and the disruption results in a luminous flare. Here we report observations over a period of 10 months of a transient, hitherto interpreted as a superluminous supernova. Our data show that the transient rebrightened substantially in the ultraviolet and that the spectrum went through three different spectroscopic phases without ever becoming nebular. Our observations are more consistent with a tidal disruption event than a superluminous supernova because of the temperature evolution, the presence of highly ionised CNO gas in the line of sight and our improved localisation of the transient in the nucleus of a passive galaxy, where the presence of massive stars is highly unlikely. While the supermassive black hole has a mass $> 10^8 M_\odot$, a star with the same mass as the Sun could be disrupted outside the event horizon if the black hole were spinning rapidly. The rapid spin and high black hole mass can explain the high luminosity of this event.},

abstract = {Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are very bright explosions that were only discovered recently and that show a preference for occurring in faint dwarf galaxies. Understanding why stellar evolution yields different types of stellar explosions in these environments is fundamental in order to both uncover the elusive progenitors of SLSNe and to study star formation in dwarf galaxies. In this paper, we present the first results of our project to study SUperluminous Supernova Host galaxIES, focusing on the sample for which we have obtained spectroscopy. We show that SLSNe-I and SLSNe-R (hydrogen-poor) often ($\sim$50% in our sample) occur in a class of galaxies that is known as Extreme Emission Line Galaxies (EELGs). The probability of this happening by chance is negligible and we therefore conclude that the extreme environmental conditions and the SLSN phenomenon are related. In contrast, SLSNe-II (hydrogen-rich) occur in more massive, more metal-rich galaxies with softer radiation fields. Therefore, if SLSNe-II constitute a uniform class, their progenitor systems are likely different from those of H-poor SLSNe. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are, on average, not found in as extreme environments as H-poor SLSNe. We propose that H-poor SLSNe result from the very first stars exploding in a starburst, even earlier than GRBs. This might indicate a bottom-light initial mass function in these systems. SLSNe present a novel method of selecting candidate EELGs independent of their luminosity.},

abstract = {We present a quantitative model for the infrared emission from dust in the diffuse interstellar medium. The model consists of a mixture of amorphous silicate grains and carbonaceous grains, each with a wide size distribution ranging from molecules containing tens of atoms to large grains > 1 um in diameter. We assume that the carbonaceous grains have polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-like properties at very small sizes, and graphitic properties for radii a > 50 A. On the basis of recent laboratory studies and guided by astronomical observations, we propose "astronomical" absorption cross sections for use in modeling neutral and ionized PAHs from the far ultraviolet to the far infrared. We also propose modifications to the far-infrared emissivity of "astronomical silicate". We calculate energy distribution functions for small grains undergoing "temperature spikes" due to stochastic absorption of starlight photons, using realistic heat capacities and optical properties. Using a grain size distribution consistent with the observed interstellar extinction, we are able to reproduce the near-IR to submillimeter emission spectrum of the diffuse interstellar medium, including the PAH emission features at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3um. The model is compared with the observed emission at high Galactic latitudes as well as in the Galactic plane, as measured by COBE and IRTS. We calculate infrared emission spectra for our dust model heated by a range of starlight intensities, and we provide tabulated dust opacities (extended tables available at http://www.astro.princeton.edu/$\sim$draine/dust/dustmix.html)},

abstract = {This is the third paper of a series in which we present new measurements of the observed rates of supernovae (SNe) in the local Universe, determined from the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS). We have considered a sample of ∼1000 SNe and used an optimal subsample of 726 SNe (274 SNe Ia, 116 SNe Ibc and 324 SNe II) to determine our rates. We study the trend of the rates as a function of a few quantities available for our galaxy sample, such as luminosity in the B and K bands, stellar mass and morphological class. We discuss different choices (SN samples, input SN luminosity functions, inclination correction factors) and their effect on the rates and their uncertainties. A comparison between our SN rates and the published measurements shows that they are consistent with each other to within the uncertainties when the rate calculations are done in the same manner. Nevertheless, our data demonstrate that the rates cannot be adequately described by a single parameter using either galaxy Hubble types or B-K colours. A secondary parameter in galaxy 'size', expressed by luminosity or stellar mass, is needed to adequately describe the rates in the rate-size relation: the galaxies of smaller sizes have higher SN rates per unit mass or per unit luminosity. The trends of the SN rates in galaxies of different Hubble types and colours are discussed. We examine possible causes for the rate-size relation. Physically, such a relation for the core-collapse SNe is probably linked to the correlation between the specific star-formation rate and the galaxy sizes, but it is not clear whether the same link can be established for SNe Ia. We discuss the two-component ('tardy' and 'prompt') model for SN Ia rates, and find that the SN Ia rates in young stellar populations might have a strong correlation with the core-collapse SN rates. We derive volumetric rates for the different SN types [e.g. for SNe Ia, a rate of (0.301 ± 0.062) × 10-4 SN Mpc-3yr-1 at redshift 0] and compare them to the measurements at different redshifts. Finally, we estimate the SN rate for the Milky Way Galaxy to be 2.84 ± 0.60 SNe per century (with a systematic uncertainty of a factor of ∼2), consistent with published SN rates based on several different techniques. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2011 RAS.},

abstract = {We introduce a Bayesian approach for modeling Voigt profiles in absorption spectroscopy and its implementation in the python package, BayesVP, publicly available at https://github.com/cameronliang/BayesVP. The code fits the absorption line profiles within specified wavelength ranges and generates posterior distributions for the column density, Doppler parameter, and redshifts of the corresponding absorbers. The code uses publicly available efficient parallel sampling packages to sample posterior and thus can be run on parallel platforms. BayesVP supports simultaneous fitting for multiple absorption components in high-dimensional parameter space. We provide other useful utilities in the package, such as explicit specification of priors of model parameters, continuum model, Bayesian model comparison criteria, and posterior sampling convergence check.},

abstract = {We present a description of the Australian Dark Energy Survey (OzDES) and summarize the results from its 6 years of operations. Using the 2dF fibre positioner and AAOmega spectrograph on the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope, OzDES has monitored 771 active galactic nuclei, classified hundreds of supernovae, and obtained redshifts for thousands of galaxies that hosted a transient within the 10 deep fields of the Dark Energy Survey. We also present the second OzDES data release, containing the redshifts of almost 30 000 sources, some as faint as rAB = 24 mag, and 375 000 individual spectra. These data, in combination with the time-series photometry from the Dark Energy Survey, will be used to measure the expansion history of the Universe out to z ∼ 1.2 and the masses of hundreds of black holes out to z ∼ 4. OzDES is a template for future surveys that combine simultaneous monitoring of targets with wide-field imaging cameras and wide-field multi-object spectrographs.},

It is found that the Amati relation of low-$z$ GRBs differs from that of high-$z$ GRBs at more than $3\sigma$ confidence level. This result is insensitive to cosmological models.

abstract = {We study the galactic wind in the edge-on spiral galaxy UGC 10043 with the combi-nation of the CALIFA integral field spectroscopy data, scanning Fabry-Perot interferometry (FPI), and multiband photometry. We detect ionized gas in the extraplanar regions reaching a relatively high distance, up to ∼ 4 kpc above the galactic disk. The ionized gas line ra-tios ([N ii]/H$\alpha$, [S ii]/H$\alpha$ and [O i]/H$\alpha$) present an enhancement along the semi minor axis, in contrast with the values found at the disk, where they are compatible with ionization due to H ii-regions. These differences, together with the biconic symmetry of the extra-planar ion-ized structure, makes UGC 10043 a clear candidate for a galaxy with gas outflows ionizated by shocks. From the comparison of shock models with the observed line ratios, and the kinemat-ics observed from the FPI data, we constrain the physical properties of the observed outflow. The data are compatible with a velocity increase of the gas along the extraplanar distances up to < 400 km s −1 and the preshock density decreasing in the same direction. We also observe a discrepancy in the SFR estimated based on H$\alpha$ (0.36 M yr −1) and the estimated with the CIGALE code, being the latter 5 times larger. Nevertheless, this SFR is still not enough to drive the observed galactic wind if we do not take into account the filling factor. We stress that the combination of the three techniques of observation with models is a powerful tool to explore galactic winds in the Local Universe.},

abstract = {(Abridged) We have performed a comprehensive multiwavelength analysis of a sample of 20 starburst galaxies that show the presence of a substantial population of very young massive stars. In this paper, the second of the series, we present the results of the analysis of long-slit intermediate-resolution spectroscopy of star-formation bursts for 16 galaxies of our sample. We study the spatial localization of the WR stars in each galaxy. We analyze the excitation mechanism and derive the reddening coefficient, physical conditions and chemical abundances of the ionized gas. We study the kinematics of the ionized gas to check the rotation/turbulence pattern of each system. When possible, tentative estimates of the Keplerian mass of the galaxies have been calculated. Our analysis has revealed that a substantial fraction of the galaxies show evidences of perturbed kinematics. With respect to the results found in individual galaxies, we remark the detection of objects with different metallicity and decoupled kinematics in Haro 15 and Mkn 1199, the finding of evidences of tidal streams in IRAS 08208+2816, Tol 9 and perhaps in SBS 1319+579, and the development of a merging process in SBS 0926+606 A and in Tol 1457-262. All these results reinforce the hypothesis that interactions with or between dwarf objects is a very important mechanism in the triggering of massive star formation in starburst galaxies, specially in dwarf ones. It must be highlighted that only deep and very detailed observationscan provide clear evidences that these subtle interaction processes are taking place.},

In analysis of archival survey data, we have discovered a 30-Jy dispersed burst of duration <5 ms located three degrees from the Small Magellanic Cloud. The burst properties argue against a physical association with our Galaxy or the Small Magellanic Cloud. Current models for the free electron content in the Universe imply a distance to the burst of <1 Gpc No further bursts are seen in 90-hr of additional observations, implying that it was a singular event such as a supernova or coalescence of relativistic objects.

Our sample contains all objects from the PS1 MDS sample with spectroscopic classification that are similar to either of the prototypes SN2005ap or SN2007bi, without an explicit limit on luminosity. With a redshift range $0.3 < z < 1.6$, PS1MDS is the first SLSN sample primarily probing the high-redshift population; our multi-filter PS1 light curves probe the rest-frame UV emission, and hence the peak of the spectral energy distribution. We measure the temperature evolution and construct bolometric light curves, and find peak luminosities of $(0.5-5) \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and lower limits on the total radiated energies of $(0.3-2) \times 10^{51}$ erg. The light curve shapes are diverse, with both rise- and decline times spanning a factor of $\sim 5$, and several examples of double-peaked light curves. When correcting for the flux-limited nature of our survey, we find a median peak luminosity at 4000 {\AA} of $M_{\rm 4000} = -21.1$ mag, and a spread of $\sigma = 0.7$ mag.},

abstract = {{We present optical spectroscopy and optical/near-IR photometry of 31 host galaxies of hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), including 15 events from the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey. Our sample spans the redshift range 0.1 < z < 1.6 and is the first comprehensive host galaxy study of this specific subclass of cosmic explosions. Combining the multi-band photometry and emission-line measurements, we determine the luminosities, stellar masses, star formation rates and metallicities. We find that as a whole, the hosts of SLSNe are a low-luminosity (<M_B> $\sim$ -17.3 mag), low stellar mass (<M_*> $\sim$ 2 x 10^8 M_sun) population, with a high median specific star formation rate (<sSFR> $\sim$ 2 Gyr^-1). The median metallicity of our spectroscopic sample is low, 12 + log(O/H}) $\sim$ 8.35 $\sim$ 0.45 Z_sun, although at least one host galaxy has solar metallicity. The host galaxies of H-poor SLSNe are statistically distinct from the hosts of GOODS core-collapse SNe (which cover a similar redshift range), but resemble the host galaxies of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) in terms of stellar mass, SFR, sSFR and metallicity. This result indicates that the environmental causes leading to massive stars forming either SLSNe or LGRBs are similar, and in particular that SLSNe are more effectively formed in low metallicity environments. We speculate that the key ingredient is large core angular momentum, leading to a rapidly-spinning magnetar in SLSNe and an accreting black hole in LGRBs.},

abstract = {We present X-ray source catalogs for the $\approx7$ Ms exposure of the Chandra Deep Field-South (CDF-S), which covers a total area of 484.2 arcmin$^2$. Utilizing WAVDETECT for initial source detection and ACIS Extract for photometric extraction and significance assessment, we create a main source catalog containing 1008 sources that are detected in up to three X-ray bands: 0.5-7.0 keV, 0.5-2.0 keV, and 2-7 keV. A supplementary source catalog is also provided including 47 lower-significance sources that have bright ($K_s\le23$) near-infrared counterparts. We identify multiwavelength counterparts for 992 (98.4%) of the main-catalog sources, and we collect redshifts for 986 of these sources, including 653 spectroscopic redshifts and 333 photometric redshifts. Based on the X-ray and multiwavelength properties, we identify 711 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from the main-catalog sources. Compared to the previous $\approx4$ Ms CDF-S catalogs, 291 of the main-catalog sources are new detections. We have achieved unprecedented X-ray sensitivity with average flux limits over the central $\approx1$ arcmin$^2$ region of $\approx1.9\times10^{-17}$, $6.4\times10^{-18}$, and $2.7\times10^{-17}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the three X-ray bands, respectively. We provide cumulative number-count measurements observing, for the first time, that normal galaxies start to dominate the X-ray source population at the faintest 0.5-2.0 keV flux levels. The highest X-ray source density reaches $\approx50\,500$ deg$^{-2}$, and $47\%\pm4\%$ of these sources are AGNs ($\approx23\,900$ deg$^{-2}$).},

abstract = {AT 2018cow was the nearest and best-studied example of a new breed of extragalactic, luminous, and rapidly evolving transient. Both the progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms of these rapid transients remain a mystery – the energetics, spectral signatures, and time-scales make them challenging to interpret in established classes of supernovae and tidal disruption events. The rich, multiwavelength data set of AT 2018cow has still left several interpretations viable to explain the nature of this event. In this paper, we analyze integral-field spectroscopic data of the host galaxy, CGCG 137-068, to compare environmental constraints with leading progenitor models. We find the explosion site of AT 2018cow to be very typical of core-collapse supernovae (known to form from stars with MZAMS ∼ 8−25 M⊙), and infer a young stellar population age at the explosion site of few × 10 Myr, at slightly sub-solar metallicity. When comparing to expectations for exotic intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) tidal disruption events, we find no evidence for a potential host system of the IMBH. In particular, there are no abrupt changes in metallicity or kinematics in the vicinity of the explosion site, arguing against the presence of a distinct host system. The proximity of AT 2018cow to strong star formation in the host galaxy makes us favour a massive stellar progenitor for this event.},

abstract = {We suggest that fast-rising blue optical transients (FBOTs) and the brightest event of the class, AT2018cow, result from an electron-capture collapse to a neutron star following the merger of a massive ONeMg white dwarf (WD) with another WD. Two distinct evolutionary channels lead to the disruption of the less-massive WD during the merger and the formation of a shell-burning non-degenerate star incorporating the ONeMg core. During the shell-burning stage, a large fraction of the envelope is lost to the wind, while mass and angular momentum are added to the core. As a result, the electron-capture collapse occurs with a small envelope mass, after ∼102-104 yr. During the formation of a neutron star, as little as 10-2 M⊙ of the material is ejected at the bounce-off with mildly relativistic velocities and total energy of about a few 1050 erg. This ejecta becomes optically thin on a time-scale of days - this is the FBOT. During the collapse, the neutron star is spun up and the magnetic field is amplified. The ensuing fast magnetically dominated relativistic wind from the newly formed neutron star shocks against the ejecta, and later against the wind. The radiation-dominated forward shock produces the long-lasting optical afterglow, while the termination shock of the relativistic wind produces the high-energy emission in a manner similar to pulsar wind nebulae. If the secondary WD was of the DA type, the wind will likely have - 10-4 M⊙ of hydrogen; this explains the appearance of hydrogen late in the afterglow spectrum. The model explains many of the puzzling properties of FBOTs/AT2018cow: host galaxies, a fast and light anisotropic ejecta producing a bright optical peak, afterglow high-energy emission of similar luminosity to the optical, and late infrared features.},

These absorbers are examined in detail using data from the Echelle Spectrograph and Imager (ESI) on the Keck II telescope. Many low-ionization lines including Fe ii, Zn ii, Mg ii, Si ii, Al ii, Ni ii, Mn ii, Cr ii, Ti ii, and Ca ii are present in the same absorber which gives rise to the 217 A bump. The relative metal abundances (with respect to Zn) demonstrate that the depletion patterns of our 217 A dust absorbers resemble that of the Milky Way clouds although some are disk-like and some are halo-like. The 217 A dust absorbers have significantly higher depletion levels compared to literature Damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs) and subDLAs. The dust depletion level indicator [Fe/Zn] tends to anti-correlate with bump strengths. The velocity profiles from the Keck/ESI spectra also provide kinematical information on the dust absorbers. The dust absorbers are found to have multiple velocity components with velocity widths extending from ∼ 100 to ∼ 600 km s −1 , which are larger than those of most DLAs and subDLAs. Assuming the velocity width is a reliable tracer of stellar mass, the host galaxies of 217 A dust absorbers are expected to be more massive than DLA/subDLA hosts. Not all of the 217 A dust absorbers are intervening systems towards background quasars. The absorbers towards quasars J1006+1538 and J1047+3423 are proximate systems that could be associated with the quasar itself or the host galaxy.},

Whereas traditional measurements of H_0 with SNe Ia use a distance ladder of parallax and Cepheid variable stars, the inverse distance ladder relies on absolute distance measurements from the BAOs to calibrate the intrinsic magnitude of the SNe Ia. We find H_0 = 67.8 +/- 1.3 km s-1 Mpc-1 (statistical and systematic uncertainties, 68% confidence). Our measurement makes minimal assumptions about the underlying cosmological model, and our analysis was blinded to reduce confirmation bias. We examine possible systematic uncertainties and all are below the statistical uncertainties. Our H_0 value is consistent with estimates derived from the Cosmic Microwave Background assuming a LCDM universe (Planck Collaboration et al. 2018).},

abstract = {Over the past two decades, an avalanche of data from multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopic surveys has revolutionized our view of galaxy formation and evolution. Here we review the range of complementary techniques and theoretical tools that allow astronomers to map the cosmic history of star formation, heavy element production, and reionization of the Universe from the cosmic "dark ages" to the present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at z$\sim$1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a redshift z = 1.3. About 25% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density, and another 25% formed after z = 0.7. Less than $\sim$1% of today's stars formed during the epoch of reionization. Under the assumption of a universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass density inferred at any epoch matches reasonably well the time integral of all the preceding star-formation activity. The comoving rates of star formation and central black hole accretion follow a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for co-evolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than ten hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons per baryon, a rather tight budget for cosmological reionization.},

abstract = {We present initial results of an ESO-VLT large programme (AMAZE) aimed at determining the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation at z>3 by means of deep near-IR spectroscopy. Gas metallicities are measured, for an initial sample of nine star forming galaxies at z$\sim$3.5, by means of optical nebular lines redshifted into the near-IR. Stellar masses are accurately determined by using Spitzer-IRAC data, which sample the rest-frame near-IR stellar light in these distant galaxies. When compared with previous surveys, the mass-metallicity relation inferred at z$\sim$3.5 shows an evolution much stronger than observed at lower redshifts. The evolution is prominent even in massive galaxies, indicating that z$\sim$3 is an epoch of major action in terms of star formation and metal enrichment also for massive systems. There are also indications that the metallicity evolution of low mass galaxies is stronger relative to high mass systems, an effect which can be considered the chemical version of the galaxy downsizing. The mass-metallicity relation observed at z$\sim$3.5 is difficult to reconcile with the predictions of some hierarchical evolutionary models. Such discrepancies suggest that at z>3 galaxies are assembled mostly with relatively un-evolved sub-units, i.e. small galaxies with low star formation efficiency. The bulk of the star formation and metallicity evolution probably occurs once small galaxies are already assembled into bigger systems.},

abstract = {We investigate the metallicity properties of host galaxies of long Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) in the light of the Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR), the tight dependence of metallicity on mass and SFR recently discovered for SDSS galaxies with stellar masses above 10^9.2 Msun. As most of the GRB hosts have masses below this limit, the FMR can only be used after an extension towards lower masses. At this aim, we study the FMR for galaxies with masses down to $\sim$10^8.3 Msun, finding that the FMR does extend smoothly at lower masses, albeit with a much larger scatter. We then compare the resulting FMR with the metallicity properties of 18 host galaxies of long GRBs. While the GRB hosts show a systematic offset with respect to the mass-metallicity relation, they are fully consistent with the FMR. This shows that the difference with the mass-metallicity relation is due to higher than average SFRs, and that GRBs with optical afterglows do not preferentially select low-metallicity hosts among the star-forming galaxies. The apparent low metallicity is therefore a consequence of the occurrence of long GRB in low mass, actively star-forming galaxies, known to dominate the current cosmic SFR.},

Here we present 466 new spectroscopic redshifts for radio sources in ATLAS as part of our optical follow-up programme. Of the 466 radio sources with new spectroscopic redshifts, 142 have star-forming optical spectra, 282 show evidence for active galactic nuclei (AGN) in their optical spectra, 10 have stellar spectra and 32 have spectra revealing redshifts, but with insufficient features to classify. We compare our spectroscopic classifications with two mid-infrared diagnostics and find them to be in broad agreement. We also construct the radio luminosity function for star-forming galaxies to z = 0.5 and for AGN to z = 0.8. The radio luminosity function for star-forming galaxies appears to be in good agreement with previous studies. The radio luminosity function for AGN appears higher than previous studies of the local AGN radio luminosity function. We explore the possibility of evolution, cosmic variance and classification techniques affecting the AGN radio luminosity function.

abstract = {Evolutionary population synthesis models for a wide range of metallicities, ages, star formation histories, initial mass functions and horizontal branch morphologies, including blue morphologies at high metallicity, are computed. The model output comprises spectral energy distributions, colours, stellar M/L ratios, bolometric corrections and near-infrared (IR) spectral line indices. The energetics of the post main sequence evolutionary phases are evaluated with the fuel consumption theorem. The impact on the models of the stellar evolutionary tracks (in particular with and without overshooting) is assessed. We find modest differences in synthetic broad-band colours as induced by the use of different tracks in our code [e.g. $\Delta$(V - K) ∼ 0.08 mag, $\Delta$(B - V) ∼ 0.03 mag]. Noticeably, these differences are substantially smaller than the scatter among other models in the literature, even when the latter adopt the same evolutionary tracks. The models are calibrated with globular cluster data from the Milky Way for old ages, and the Magellanic clouds plus the merger remnant galaxy NGC 7252, both for young ages of ∼0.1-2 Gyr, in a large wavelength range from the U band to the K band. Particular emphasis is put on the contribution from the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) phase. We show that this evolutionary phase is crucial for the modelling of young stellar populations by direct comparison with observed spectral energy distributions of Magellanic cloud clusters, which are characterized by relatively high fluxes, both blueward and redward of the V band. We find that the combination of the near-IR spectral indices C2 and H2O can be used to determine the metallicity of ∼1 Gyr stellar populations. As an illustrative application, we re-analyse the spectral energy distributions of some of the high-z galaxies (2.4 ≲ z ≲ 2.9) observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope by Yan et al. Their high rest-frame near-IR fluxes is reproduced very well with the models including TP-AGB stars for ages in the range ∼0.6-1.5 Gyr, suggesting formation redshifts for these objects around z ∼ 3-6. {\textcopyright} 2005 RAS.},

abstract = {We present the first extensive radio to gamma-ray observations of a fast-rising blue optical transient (FBOT), AT2018cow, over its first $\sim$100 days. AT2018cow rose over a few days to a peak luminosity $L_{pk}\sim4\times 10^{44}$ erg/s exceeding those of superluminous supernovae (SNe), before declining as $\propto t^{-2}$. Initial spectra at $\lesssim 15$ days were mostly featureless and indicated large expansion velocities v$\sim$0.1c and temperatures reaching 30000 K. Later spectra revealed a persistent optically-thick photosphere and the emergence of H and He emission features with v$\sim$sim 4000 km/s with no evidence for ejecta cooling. Our broad-band monitoring revealed a hard X-ray spectral component at $E\ge 10$ keV, in addition to luminous and highly variable soft X-rays, with properties unprecedented among astronomical transients. An abrupt change in the X-ray decay rate and variability appears to accompany the change in optical spectral properties. AT2018cow showed bright radio emission consistent with the interaction of a blastwave with $v_{sh}$$\sim$0.1c with a dense environment ($\dot M\sim10^{-3}-10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$ for $v_w=1000$ km\s). While these properties exclude Ni-powered transients, our multi-wavelength analysis instead indicates that AT2018cow harbored a "central engine", either a compact object (magnetar or black hole) or an embedded internal shock produced by interaction with a compact, dense circumstellar medium. The engine released $\sim10^{50}-10^{51.5}$ erg over $\sim10^3-10^5$ s and resides within low-mass fast-moving material with equatorial-polar density asymmetry ($M_{ej,fast}\lesssim0.3\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$). Successful SNe from low-mass H-rich stars (like electron-capture SNe) or failed explosions from blue supergiants satisfy these constraints. Intermediate-mass black-holes are disfavored by the large environmental density probed by the radio observations.},

abstract = {The use of IFS is since recently allowing to measure the emission line fluxes of an increasingly large number of star-forming galaxies both locally and at high redshift. The main goal of this study is to review the most widely used empirical oxygen calibrations, O3N2 and N2, by using new direct abundance measurements. We pay special attention to the expected uncertainty of these calibrations as a function of the index value or abundance derived and the presence of possible systematic offsets. This is possible thanks to the analysis of the most ambitious compilation of Te-based HII regions to date. This new dataset compiles the Te-based abundances of 603 HII regions extracted from the literature but also includes new measurements from the CALIFA survey. Besides providing new and improved empirical calibrations for the gas abundance, we also present here a comparison between our revisited calibrations with a total of 3423 additional CALIFA HII complexes with abundances derived using the ONS calibration by Pilyugin et al. (2010). The combined analysis of Te-based and ONS abundances allows us to derive their most accurate calibration to date for both the O3N2 and N2 single-ratio indicators, in terms of all statistical significance, quality and coverage of the space of parameters. In particular, we infer that these indicators show shallower abundance dependencies and statistically-significant offsets compared to those of Pettini and Pagel (2004), Nagao et al. (2006) and P\'erez-Montero and Contini (2009). The O3N2 and N2 indicators can be empirically applied to derive oxygen abundances calibrations from either direct abundance determinations with random errors of 0.18 and 0.16, respectively, or from indirect ones (but based on a large amount of data) reaching an average precision of 0.08 and 0.09 dex (random) and 0.02 and 0.08 dex (systematic; compared to the direct estimations),respectively.},

abstract = {Measurements of interstellar absorption lines in 18 ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIGs) have been combined with published data, in order to reassess the dependence of galactic outflow speeds on starburst luminosity and galactic mass. The Doppler shifts reveal outflows of relatively cool gas at $330 \pm 100$km/s. The outflow speeds increase with the star formation rate (SFR) as roughly $v \propto SFR^{0.35}$. This result is surprising since, in the traditional model for starburst-driven winds, these relatively cool gas clouds are accelerated by the ram pressure of a hot, supernova-heated wind that exhibits weak (if any) \x temperature variation with increasing galactic mass. The lack of evidence for much hotter winds is partly a sensitivity issue; but the outflow velocities in ultraluminous starbursts actually are consistent with acceleration by the tepid wind, indicating a hotter component is unlikely to dominate the momentum flux. The \nad velocities in the dwarf starburst winds do not reach the terminal velocity of a hot wind at the measured temperature of kT $\sim$0.73 keV. A dynamically-motivated explanation is that the dwarf starburst winds simply lack enough momentum to accelerate the clouds to the velocity of the hot wind. Among the subsample of starbursts with well- constrained dynamical masses, the terminal outflow velocities approach the galactic escape velocity. If this relation, which is similar to that observed for stellar winds, arises from radiation pressure on dust and gas limiting the maximum luminosity of a starburst, then feedback will be stronger in massive galaxies than previously thought helping shape the high-mass end of the galaxy luminosity function.},

The amount of mass escaping the galactic potential, in contrast to the disk, does depend on the galactic mass.

abstract = {We present Keck/LRIS spectra of over 200 galaxies with well-determined redshifts between 0.4 and 1.4. We combine new measurements of near-ultraviolet, low-ionization absorption lines with previously measured masses, luminosities, colors, and star formation rates to describe the demographics and properties of galactic flows. Among star-forming galaxies with blue colors, we find a net blueshift of the FeII absorption greater than 200 km/s (100 km/s) towards 2.5% (20%) of the galaxies. The fraction of blueshifted spectra does not vary significantly with stellar mass, color, or luminosity but does decline at specific star formation rates less than roughly 0.8 Gyr^{-1}. The insensitivity of the blueshifted fraction to galaxy properties requires collimated outflows at these redshifts, while the decline in outflow fraction with increasing blueshift might reflect the angular dependence of the outflow velocity. The low detection rate of infalling gas, 3 to 6% of the spectra, suggests an origin in (enriched) streams favorably aligned with our sightline. We find 4 of these 9 infalling streams have projected velocities commensurate with the kinematics of an extended disk or satellite galaxy. The strength of the MgII absorption increases with stellar mass, B-band luminosity, and U-B color, trends arising from a combination of more interstellar absorption at the systemic velocity and less emission filling in more massive galaxies. Our results provides a new quantitative understanding of gas flows between galaxies and the circumgalactic medium over a critical period in galaxy evolution.},

abstract = {Lyman alpha halos are observed ubiquitously around star-forming galaxies at high redshift, but their origin is still a matter of debate. We demonstrate that the emission from faint unresolved satellite sources, M UV > ∼ −17, clustered around the central galaxies may play a major role in generating spatially extended Ly$\alpha$, continuum (UV + VIS) and H$\alpha$ halos. We apply the analytic formalism developed in Mas-Ribas & Dijkstra (2016) to model the halos around Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs) at z = 3.1, for several different satellite clustering prescriptions. In general, our UV and Ly$\alpha$ surface brightness profiles match the observations well at 20 < ∼ r < ∼ 40 physical kpc from the centers of LAEs. We discuss how our profiles depend on various model assumptions and how these can be tested and constrained with future H$\alpha$ observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Our analysis shows how spatially extended halos constrain (i) the presence of otherwise undetectable satellite sources, (ii) the integrated, volumetric production rates of Ly$\alpha$ and LyC photons, and (iii) their population-averaged escape fractions. These quantities are all directly relevant for understanding galaxy formation and evolution and, for high enough redshifts, cosmic reionization.},

Hence, we conclude that there is evidence for significant non-stellar dust production, and little evidence for dust destruction due to SNe shock waves. We find that dust is reprocessed rather than destroyed by shocks from SNe. Finally, we argue that dust abundances derived using standard methods may be overestimated, since even very 'generous' estimates of the metallicity results in dust-to-metals ratios above unity in several cases, if the dust abundances given in the literature are taken at face value.},

The radial gradient of the dust-to-metals ratio is shown to be essentially flat (zero) if interstellar dust is not destroyed by SN shock waves and all dust is produced in stars. If there is net dust destruction by SN shock waves, the dust-to-metals gradient is flatter than or equal to the metallicity gradient (assuming the gradients have the same sign). Similarly, if there is net dust growth in the ISM, then the dust-to-metals gradient is steeper than or equal to the metallicity gradient. The latter result implies that if dust gradients are steeper than metallicity gradients, that is, the dust-to-metals gradients are not flat, then it is unlikely dust destruction by SN shock waves is an efficient process, while dust growth must be a significant mechanism for dust production. Moreover, we conclude that dust-to-metals gradients can be used as a diagnostic for interstellar dust growth in galaxy discs, where a negative slope indicates dust growth.},

abstract = {We present SN2018kzr, the fastest declining supernova-like transient, second only to the kilonova, AT2017gfo. SN2018kzr is characterized by a peak magnitude of $M_r = -17.98$, peak bolometric luminosity of ${\sim} 1.4 \times 10^{43}$erg s$^{\mathrm{-1}}$ and a rapid decline rate of $0.48 \pm 0.03$ mag day$^{\textrm{-1}}$ in the $r$ band. The bolometric luminosity evolves too quickly to be explained by pure $^{\mathrm{56}}$Ni heating, necessitating the inclusion of an alternative powering source. Incorporating the spin-down of a magnetized neutron star adequately describes the lightcurve and we estimate a small ejecta mass of $M_\mathrm{ej} = 0.10 \pm 0.05$ $\textrm{M}_{\odot}$. Our spectral modelling suggests the ejecta is composed of intermediate mass elements including O, Si and Mg and trace amounts of Fe-peak elements, which disfavours a binary neutron star merger. We discuss three explosion scenarios for SN2018kzr, given the low ejecta mass, intermediate mass element composition and the high likelihood of additional powering - core collapse of an ultra-stripped progenitor, the accretion induced collapse of a white dwarf and the merger of a white dwarf and neutron star. The requirement for an alternative input energy source favours either the accretion induced collapse with magnetar powering or a white dwarf - neutron star merger with energy from disk wind shocks.},

abstract = {The Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) survey has obtained imaging in five bands (grizyP1) over 10Medium Deep Survey (MDS) fields covering a total of 70 square degrees. This paper describes the search for apparently hostless supernovae (SNe) within the first year of PS1 MDS data with an aim of discovering superluminous supernovae (SLSNe). A total of 249 hostless transients were discovered down to a limiting magnitude of MAB 23.5, of which 76 were classified as Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). There were 57 SNe with complete light curves that are likely core-collapse SNe (CCSNe) or type Ic SLSNe and 12 of these have had spectra taken. Of these 12 hostless, non-Type Ia SNe, 7 were SLSNe of type Ic at redshifts between 0.5 and 1.4. This illustrates that the discovery rate of type Ic SLSNe can be maximized by concentrating on hostless transients and removing normal SNe Ia. We present data for two possible SLSNe; PS1-10pm (z = 1.206) and PS1-10ahf (z = 1.1), and estimate the rate of type Ic SLSNe to be between 3+3 -2 × 10-5 and 8+2 -1 × 10-5 that of the CCSN rate within 0.3 ≤ z ≤ 1.4 by applying a Monte Carlo technique. The rate of slowly evolving, type Ic SLSNe (such as SN2007bi) is estimated as a factor of 10 lower than this range.},

abstract = {Long-duration Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) allow us to pinpoint and study star-forming galaxies in the early universe, thanks to their orders of magnitude brighter peak luminosities compared to other astrophysical sources, and their association with deaths of massive stars. We present Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 detections of three Swift GRB host galaxies lying at redshifts $z = 5.913$ (GRB 130606A), $z = 6.295$ (GRB 050904), and $z = 6.327$ (GRB 140515A) in the F140W (wide-$JH$ band, $\lambda_{\rm{obs}}\sim1.4\,\mu m$) filter. The hosts have magnitudes (corrected for Galactic extinction) of $m_{\rm{\lambda_{obs},AB}}= 26.34^{+0.14}_{-0.16}, 27.56^{+0.18}_{-0.22},$ and $28.30^{+0.25}_{-0.33}$ respectively. In all three cases the probability of chance coincidence of lower redshift galaxies is $\lesssim2\,\%$, indicating that the detected galaxies are most likely the GRB hosts. These are the first detections of high redshift ($z > 5$) GRB host galaxies in emission. The galaxies have luminosities in the range $0.1-0.6\,L^{*}_{z=6}$ (with $M_{1600}^{*}=-20.95\pm0.12$), and half-light radii in the range $0.6-0.9\,\rm{kpc}$. Both their half-light radii and luminosities are consistent with existing samples of Lyman-break galaxies at $z\sim6$. Spectroscopic analysis of the GRB afterglows indicate low metallicities ($[\rm{M/H}]\lesssim-1$) and low dust extinction ($A_{\rm{V}}\lesssim0.1$) along the line of sight. Using stellar population synthesis models, we explore the implications of each galaxy's luminosity for its possible star formation history, and consider the potential for emission-line metallicity determination with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope.},

abstract = {We review current understanding of star formation, outlining an overall theoretical framework and the observations that motivate it. A conception of star formation has emerged in which turbulence plays a dual role, both creating overdensities to initiate gravitational contraction or collapse, and countering the effects of gravity in these overdense regions. The key dynamical processes involved in star formation{\mdash}turbulence, magnetic fields, and self-gravity{\mdash}are highly nonlinear and multidimensional. Physical arguments are used to identify and explain the features and scalings involved in star formation, and results from numerical simulations are used to quantify these effects. We divide star formation into large-scale and small-scale regimes and review each in turn. Large scales range from galaxies to giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and their substructures. Important problems include how GMCs form and evolve, what determines the star formation rate (SFR), and what determines the initial mass function (IMF). Small scales range from dense cores to the protostellar systems they beget. We discuss formation of both low- and high-mass stars, including ongoing accretion. The development of winds and outflows is increasingly well understood, as are the mechanisms governing angular momentum transport in disks. Although outstanding questions remain, the framework is now in place to build a comprehensive theory of star formation that will be tested by the next generation of telescopes.},

abstract = {We introduce a dust model for cosmological simulations implemented in the moving-mesh code AREPO and present a suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations to study dust formation within galactic haloes. Our model accounts for the stellar production of dust, accretion of gas-phase metals onto existing grains, destruction of dust through local supernova activity, and dust driven by winds from star-forming regions. We find that accurate stellar and active galactic nuclei feedback is needed to reproduce the observed dust-metallicity relation and that dust growth largely dominates dust destruction. Our simulations predict a dust content of the interstellar medium which is consistent with observed scaling relations at $z = 0$, including scalings between dust-to-gas ratio and metallicity, dust mass and gas mass, dust-to-gas ratio and stellar mass, and dust-to-stellar mass ratio and gas fraction. We find that roughly two-thirds of dust at $z = 0$ originated from Type II supernovae, with the contribution from asymptotic giant branch stars below 20 per cent for $z \gtrsim 5$. While our suite of Milky Way-sized galaxies forms dust in good agreement with a number of key observables, it predicts a high dust-to-metal ratio in the circumgalactic medium, which motivates a more realistic treatment of thermal sputtering of grains and dust cooling channels.},

We find that cosmological simulations post-processed with detailed radiative transfer calculations generally are able to reproduce the observed abundance of Lyman-limit systems, and we highlight possible discrepancies between the observations and simulations. This comparison tests cosmological simulations at overdensities of $\sim$100. Furthermore, we show that the properties of Lyman-limit systems in these simulations, in simple semi-analytic arguments, and as suggested by recent observations indicate that a small change in the ionizing emissivity of the sources would have resulted in a much larger change in the amplitude of the intergalactic HI-ionizing background (with this scaling strengthening with increasing redshift). This strong scaling could explain the rapid evolution in the Lyman-alpha forest transmission observed at z = 6. Our calculations agree with the suggestion of simpler models that the comoving ionizing emissivity was constant or even increasing from z = 3 to 6. Our calculations also provide a more rigorous estimate than in previous studies for the clumping factor of intergalactic gas after reionization, which we estimate was 2 - 3 at z = 6.},

A secondary objective is to compute burst locations on-board to allow re-orientiong the spacecraft so that the LAT can observe delayed emission from bright bursts. GBM uses an array of twelve sodium iodide scintillators and two bismuth germanate scintillators to detect gamma rays from $\sim$8 keV to $\sim$40 MeV over the full unocculted sky.

abstract = {We measure the weak-lensing masses and galaxy distributions of four massive galaxy clusters observed during the Science Verification phase of the Dark Energy Survey. This pathfinder study is meant to 1) validate the DECam imager for the task of measuring weak-lensing shapes, and 2) utilize DECam's large field of view to map out the clusters and their environments over 90 arcmin. We conduct a series of rigorous tests on astrometry, photometry, image quality, PSF modeling, and shear measurement accuracy to single out flaws in the data and also to identify the optimal data processing steps and parameters. We find Science Verification data from DECam to be suitable for the lensing analysis described in this paper. The PSF is generally well-behaved, but the modeling is rendered difficult by a flux-dependent PSF width and ellipticity. We employ photometric redshifts to distinguish between foreground and background galaxies, and a red-sequence cluster finder to provide cluster richness estimates and cluster-galaxy distributions. By fitting NFW profiles to the clusters in this study, we determine weak-lensing masses that are in agreement with previous work. For Abell 3261, we provide the first estimates of redshift, weak-lensing mass, and richness. In addition, the cluster-galaxy distributions indicate the presence of filamentary structures attached to 1E 0657-56 and RXC J2248.7-4431, stretching out as far as 1 degree (approximately 20 Mpc), showcasing the potential of DECam and DES for detailed studies of degree-scale features on the sky.},

abstract = {MgII absorbers induce reddening on background quasars. We measure this effect and infer the cosmic density of dust residing in these systems to be \Omega\ $\sim$ 2e-6, in units of the critical density of the Universe, which is comparable to the amount of dust found in galactic disks or about half the amount inferred to exist outside galaxies. We also estimate the neutral hydrogen abundance in MgII clouds to be \Omega\ $\sim$ 1.5e-4, which is approximately 5% of hydrogen in stars in galaxies. This implies a dust-to-gas mass ratio for MgII clouds of about 1/100, which is similar to the value for normal galaxies. This would support the hypothesis of the outflow origin of MgII clouds, which are intrinsically devoid of stars and hence have no sources of dust. Considerations of the dust abundance imply that the presence of MgII absorbers around galaxies lasts effectively for a few Gyr. High redshift absorbers allow us to measure the rest-frame extinction curve to 900 Angstroms at which the absorption by the Lyman edge dominates over scattering by dust in the extinction opacity.},

abstract = {Sub-arcsecond localization of the repeating fast radio burst FRB 121102 revealed its coincidence with a dwarf host galaxy and a steady (`quiescent') non-thermal radio source. We show that the properties of the host galaxy are consistent with those of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRB) and hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I). Both LGRBs and SLSNe-I were previously hypothesized to be powered by the electromagnetic spin-down of newly-formed, strongly-magnetized neutron stars with millisecond birth rotation periods (`millisecond magnetars'). This motivates considering a scenario whereby the repeated bursts from FRB 121102 originate from a young magnetar remnant embedded within a young hydrogen-poor supernova remnant. Requirements on the GHz free-free optical depth through the expanding supernova ejecta (accounting for photo-ionization by the rotationally-powered magnetar nebula), energetic constraints on the bursts, and constraints on the size of the quiescent source all point to an age of less than a few decades to a century. The quiescent radio source can be attributed to synchrotron emission from the shock interaction between the fast outer layer of the supernova ejecta with the surrounding wind of the progenitor star, or from deeper within the magnetar wind nebula. Alternatively, the radio emission could be an orphan afterglow from an initially off-axis LGRB jet, though this might require the source to be too young. The young age of the source can be tested by searching for a time derivative of the dispersion measure and predicted fading of the quiescent radio source. We propose future tests of the SLSNe-I/LGRB/FRB connection, such as searches for FRBs from nearby SLSNe-I/LGRB on timescales of decades after their explosions.},

abstract = {Strongly-magnetized, rapidly-rotating neutron stars are contenders for the central engines of both long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) and hydrogen-poor super-luminous supernovae (SLSNe-I). Models for typical ($\sim$minute long) LGRBs invoke magnetars with high dipole magnetic fields (Bd > 1e15 G) and short spin-down times, while models for SLSNe-I invoke neutron stars with weaker fields and longer spin-down times of weeks. Here we identify a transition region in the space of Bd and birth period for which a magnetar can power both a long GRB and a luminous SN. In particular, we show that a 2 ms period magnetar with a spin-down time of $\sim$1e4 s can explain the observations of both the ultra-long GRB 111209 and its associated luminous SN2011kl. For magnetars with longer spin down times, we predict even longer duration ($\sim$1e6 s) GRBs and brighter supernovae, a correlation that extends to Swift J2058+05 (commonly interpreted as a tidal disruption event). We further show that previous estimates of the maximum rotational energy of a proto-magnetar were too conservative and energies up to Emax $\sim$1-2e53 erg are possible. The magnetar model can therefore comfortably accommodate the extreme energy requirements recently posed by the most luminous supernova ASASSN-15lh. The high ionization flux from a pulsar wind nebula powering ASASSN-15lh may lead to an "ionization break-out" X-ray burst over the coming months, which would be accompanied by an abrupt change in the optical spectrum. We conclude by briefly contrasting millisecond magnetar and black hole models for SLSNe and ultra-long GRBs.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to determine the level of obscured star formation activity and dust attenuation in a sample of gamma-ray burst (GRB) hosts, and to test the hypothesis that GRB hosts have properties consistent with those of the general star-forming galaxy populations. We present a radio continuum survey of all z < 1 GRB hosts in The Optically Unbiased GRB Host (TOUGH) sample supplemented with radio data for all (mostly pre-Swift) GRB-SN hosts discovered before 2006 October. We present new radio data for 22 objects and have obtained a detection for three of them (GRB 980425, 021211, 031203; none in the TOUGH sample), increasing the number of radio-detected GRB hosts from two to five. The star formation rate (SFR) for the GRB 021211 host of ∼825 M yr −1 , the highest ever reported for a GRB host, places it in the category of ultraluminous infrared galaxies. We found that at least ∼63% of GRB hosts have SFR < 100 M yr −1 and at most ∼8% can have SFR > 500 M yr −1 . For the undetected hosts the mean radio flux (<35 $\mu$Jy 3$\sigma$) corresponds to an average SFR < 15 M yr −1 . Moreover, 88% of the z 1 GRB hosts have ultraviolet dust attenuation A UV < 6.7 mag (visual attenuation A V < 3 mag). Hence, we did not find evidence for large dust obscuration in a majority of GRB hosts. Finally, we found that the distributions of SFRs and A UV of GRB hosts are consistent with those of Lyman break galaxies, H$\alpha$ emitters at similar redshifts, and of galaxies from cosmological simulations. The similarity of the GRB population with other star-forming galaxies is consistent with the hypothesis that GRBs, a least at z 1, trace a large fraction of all star formation, and are therefore less biased indicators than once thought.},

abstract = {We have recently suggested that gas accretion can be studied using host galaxies of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We obtained the first ever far-infrared (FIR) line observations of a GRB host, namely Herschel/PACS resolved [CII] 158 um and [OI] 63 um spectroscopy, as well as APEX CO(2-1) and ALMA CO(1-0) observations of the GRB 980425 host. It has elevated [CII]/FIR and [OI]/FIR ratios and higher values of star formation rate (SFR) derived from line ([CII], [OI], Ha) than from continuum (UV, IR, radio) indicators. [CII] emission exhibits a normal morphology, peaking at the galaxy center, whereas [OI] is concentrated close to the GRB position and the nearby Wolf-Rayet region. The high [OI] flux indicates high radiation field and gas density. The [CII]/CO luminosity ratio of the GRB 980425 host is close to the highest values found for local star-forming galaxies. Its CO-derived molecular gas mass is low given its SFR and metallicity, but the [CII]-derived molecular gas mass is close to the expected value. The [OI] and HI concentrations, and the high radiation field and density are consistent with the hypothesis of a very recent (at most a few tens of Myr ago) inflow of atomic gas triggering star formation. Dust has not had time to build up (explaining high line-to-continuum ratios). Such a recent enhancement of star-formation would indeed manifest itself in high SFR_line/SFR_continuum ratios, because the line indicators are sensitive only to recent (<10 Myr) activity, whereas the continuum indicators measure the SFR averaged over much longer periods ($\sim$100 Myr). Other GRB hosts exhibit a mean SFR_line/SFR_continuum of 1.74+-0.32. This is consistent with a very recent enhancement of star formation being common among GRB hosts, so galaxies which have recently experienced inflow of gas may preferentially host stars exploding as GRBs. Hence GRB hosts may be used to investigate recent gas accretion.},

abstract = {The existence of submillimeter-selected galaxies (SMGs) at redshifts z>4 has recently been confirmed. Using simultaneously all the available data from UV to radio we have modeled the spectral energy distributions of the six known spectroscopically confirmed SMGs at z>4. We find that their star formation rates (average $\sim$2500 MSun yr^{-1}), stellar ($\sim$3.6x10^{11} MSun) and dust ($\sim$6.7x10^{8} MSun) masses, extinction (A_V$\sim$2.2 mag), and gas-to-dust ratios ($\sim$60) are within the ranges for 1.7<z<3.6 SMGs. Our analysis suggests that infrared-to-radio luminosity ratios of SMGs do not change up to redshift $\sim$5 and are lower by a factor of $\sim$2.1 than the value corresponding to the local IR-radio correlation. However, we also find dissimilarities between z>4 and lower-redshift SMGs. Those at z>4 tend to be among the most star-forming, least massive and hottest ($\sim$60 K) SMGs and exhibit the highest fraction of stellar mass formed in the ongoing starburst ($\sim$45%). This indicates that at z>4 we see earlier stages of evolution of submillimeter-bright galaxies. Using the derived properties for z>4 SMGs we investigate the origin of dust at epochs less than 1.5 Gyr after the big bang. This is significant to our understanding of the evolution of the early universe. For three z>4 SMGs, asymptotic giant branch stars could be the dominant dust producers. However, for the remaining three only supernovae (SNe) are efficient and fast enough to be responsible for dust production, though requiring a very high dust yield per SN (0.15-0.65 MSun). The required dust yields are lower if a top-heavy initial mass function or significant dust growth in the interstellar medium is assumed. We estimate lower limits of the contribution of SMGs to the cosmic star formation and stellar mass densities at z$\sim$4-5 to be $\sim$4% and $\sim$1%, respectively.},

abstract = {In this work we present and discuss the observations of the Mn abundances for 247 FGK dwarfs, located in the Galactic disc with metallicity -1<Fe/H]<+0.3. The observed stars belong to the substructures of the Galaxy thick and thin discs, and to the Hercules stream. The observations were conducted using the 1.93 m telescope at Observatoire de Haute-Provence (OHP, France) equipped with the echelle type spectrographs ELODIE and SOPHIE. The abundances were derived under the LTE approximation, with an average error for the [Mn/Fe] ratio of 0.10 dex. For most of the stars in the sample Mn abundances are not available in the literature. We obtain an evolution of [Mn/Fe] ratio with the metallicity [Fe/H] consistent with previous data compilations. In particular, within the metallicity range covered by our stellar sample the [Mn/Fe] ratio is increasing with the increase of metallicity. This due to the contribution to the Galactic chemical evolution of Mn and Fe from thermonuclear supernovae. We confirm the baseline scenario where most of the Mn in the Galactic disc and in the Sun is made by thermonuclear supernovae. In particular, the effective contribution from core-collapse supernovae to the Mn in the Solar system is about 10-20%. However, present uncertainties affecting the production of Mn and Fe in thermonuclear supernovae are limiting the constraining power of the observed [Mn/Fe] trend in the Galactic discs on, e.g., the frequency of different thermonuclear supernovae populations. The different production of these two elements in different types of thermonuclear supernovae needs to be disentangled by the dependence of their relative production on the metallicity of the supernova progenitor.},

The recipes are implemented with the ESO Common Pipeline Library (CPL). X-shooter is the first of the second generation of VLT instruments. It makes possible to collect in one shot the full spectrum of the target from 300 to 2500 nm, subdivided in three arms optimised for UVB, VIS and NIR ranges, with an efficiency between 15% and 35% including the telescope and the atmosphere, and a spectral resolution varying between 3000 and 17,000. It allows observations in stare, offset modes, using the slit or an IFU, and observing sequences nodding the target along the slit. Data reduction can be performed either with a classical approach, by determining the spectral format via 2D-polynomial transformations, or with the help of a dedicated instrument physical model to gain insight on the instrument and allowing a constrained solution that depends on a few parameters with a physical meaning. In the present paper we describe the steps of data reduction necessary to fully reduce science observations in the different modes with examples on typical data calibrations and observations sequences.},

abstract = {We compare the chemical abundances at the sites of 12 nearby (z < 0.14) Type Ic supernovae (SN Ic) that showed broad lines, but had no observed gamma-ray burst (GRB), with the chemical abundances in five nearby (z < 0.25) galaxies at the sites of GRBs where broad-lined SN Ic were seen after the fireball had faded. It has previously been noted that GRB hosts are low in luminosity and low in their metal abundances. If low metallicity is sufficient to force the evolution of massive stars to end their lives as GRBs with an accompanying broad-lined SN Ic, then we would expect higher metal abundances for the broad-lined SN Ic that have no detected GRBs. This is what we observe, and this trend is independent of the choice of metallicity calibration we adopt and the mode of SN survey that found the broad-lined SN Ic. A unique feature of this analysis is that we present new spectra of the host galaxies and analyze all measurements of both samples in the same set of methods, using the galaxy emission-line measurements corrected for extinction and stellar absorption, via independent metallicity diagnostics of Kewley & Dopita, McGaugh, and Pettini & Pagel. In our small sample, the boundary between galaxies that have GRBs accompanying their broad-lined SN Ic and those that have broad-lined SN Ic without GRBs lies at an oxygen abundance of 12 + log(O/H)KD02 8.5, which corresponds to 0.2-0.6 Z⊙ depending on the adopted metallicity scale and solar abundance value. Even when we limit the comparison to SN Ic that were found in untargeted supernova surveys, the environment of every broad-lined SN Ic that had no GRB is more metal rich than the site of any broad-lined SN Ic where a GRB was detected. {\textcopyright} 2008.

abstract = {Unlike the ordinary supernovae (SNe) some of which are hydrogen and helium deficient (called Type Ic SNe), broad-lined Type Ic SNe (SNe Ic-bl) are very energetic events, and all SNe coincident with bona fide long duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) are of Type Ic-bl. Understanding the progenitors and the mechanism driving SN Ic-bl explosions vs those of their SNe Ic cousins is key to understanding the SN-GRB relationship and jet production in massive stars. Here we present the largest set of host-galaxy spectra of 28 SNe Ic and 14 SN Ic-bl, all discovered before 2013 by the same untargeted survey, namely the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF). We carefully measure their gas-phase metallicities, stellar masses (M*s) and star-formation rates (SFRs) by taking into account recent progress in the metallicity field and propagating uncertainties correctly. We further re-analyze the hosts of 10 literature SN-GRBs using the same methods and compare them to our PTF SN hosts with the goal of constraining their progenitors from their local environments by conducting a thorough statistical comparison, including upper limits. We find that the metallicities, SFRs and M*s of our PTF SN Ic-bl hosts are statistically comparable to those of SN-GRBs, but significantly lower than those of the PTF SNe Ic. The mass-metallicity relations as defined by the SNe Ic-bl and SN-GRBs are not significantly different from the same relations as defined by the SDSS galaxies, in contrast to claims by earlier works. Our findings point towards low metallicity as a crucial ingredient for SN Ic-bl and SN-GRB production since we are able to break the degeneracy between high SFR and low metallicity. We suggest that the PTF SNe Ic-bl may have produced jets that were choked inside the star or were able break out of the star as unseen low-luminosity or off-axis GRBs.},

We measure the ejecta absorption and width velocities using a new method described here and find that SNe Ic-bl with GRBs, on average, have quantifiably higher absorption velocities, as well as broader line widths than SNe without observed GRBs. In addition, we search for correlations between SN-GRB spectral properties and the energies of their accompanying GRBs. Finally, we show that the absence of clear He lines in optical spectra of SNe Ic-bl, and in particular of SN-GRBs, is not due to them being too smeared out due to the high velocities present in the ejecta. This implies that the progenitor stars of SN-GRBs are probably He-free, in addition to being H-free, which puts strong constraints on the stellar evolutionary paths needed to produce such SN-GRB progenitors at the observed low metallicities.},

abstract = {The Dark Energy Survey (DES) is a 5000 deg 2 grizY survey reaching characteristic photometric depths of 24 th magnitude (10 sigma) and enabling accurate photometry and morphology of objects ten times fainter than in SDSS. Preparations for DES have included building a dedicated 3 deg 2 CCD camera (DECam), upgrading the existing CTIO Blanco 4m telescope and developing a new high performance computing (HPC) enabled data management system (DESDM). The DESDM system will be used for processing, calibrating and serving the DES data. The total data volumes are high (∼2PB), and so considerable effort has gone into designing an automated processing and quality control system. Special purpose image detrending and photometric calibration codes have been developed to meet the data quality requirements, while survey astrometric calibration, coaddition and cataloging rely on new extensions of the AstrOmatic codes which now include tools for PSF modeling, PSF homogenization, PSF corrected model fitting cataloging and joint model fitting across multiple input images. The DESDM system has been deployed on dedicated development clusters and HPC systems in the US and Germany. An extensive program of testing with small rapid turn-around and larger campaign simulated datasets has been carried out. The system has also been tested on large real datasets, including Blanco Cosmology Survey data from the Mosaic2 camera. In Fall 2012 the DESDM system will be used for DECam commissioning, and, thereafter, the system will go into full science operations. {\textcopyright} 2012 SPIE.},

abstract = {We introduce SuperNNova, an open source supernova photometric classification framework which leverages recent advances in Deep Neural Networks. Our core algorithm is a recurrent neural network (RNN) that is trained to classify light-curves using photometric information only. Additional information such as host-galaxy redshift can be incorporated to improve performance. We evaluate our framework using realistic supernovae simulations that include survey detection. We show that our method, for the type Ia vs. non Ia supernovae classification problem, reaches accuracies greater than 96.92 +- 0.09 without any redshift information and up to 99.55 +- 0.06 when redshift, either photometric or spectroscopic, is available. Further, we show that our method attains unprecedented performance for classification of incomplete light-curves, reaching accuracies > 86.4+- 0.1 (> 93.5+-0.8) without host-galaxy redshift (with redshift information) two days before maximum light. In contrast with previous methods, there is no need for time-consuming feature engineering and we show that our method scales to very large datasets with a modest computing budget. In addition, we investigate often neglected pitfalls of machine learning algorithms. We show that commonly used algorithms suffer from poor calibration and overconfidence on out-of-distribution samples when applied to supernovae data. We devise extensive tests to estimate the robustness of classifiers and cast the learning procedure under a Bayesian light, demonstrating a much better handling of uncertainties. We study the benefits of Bayesian RNNs for SN Ia cosmology. Our code is open-sourced on https://github.com/supernnova/SuperNNova.},

abstract = {We present spectroscopic observations of the damped Lyalpha absorber at redshift z=1.9342 seen in the spectrum of the quasar Q0151+048A. The redshift of the absorber is greater than the redshift of the quasar, so the system resembles the z_abs $\sim$ z_em damped absorber at z=2.81 towards the quasar PKS0528-250. We have previously reported the detection of Lyalpha emission from the latter absorber, one of only two damped absorbers for which Lyalpha emission has unambiguously been detected. The resemblance between the PKS0528-250 and Q0151+048A systems is made closer by the detection of a weak emission feature in the trough of the Q0151+048A absorber. This leads us to consider whether these z_abs $\sim$ z_em DLA absorbers are different objects to the intervening DLA absorbers. Two possibilities are examined and rejected. Firstly the Q0151+048A and PKS0528-250 z_abs $\sim$ z_em absorbers appear to be unrelated to the intrinsic absorbers (i.e. gas close to the quasar nucleus, ejected by the quasar), as intrinsic absorbers are of higher metallicity, have higher ionisation parameter, and show complex absorption profiles. Secondly these two DLA absorbers cannot be equated with the gaseous disks of the quasar host galaxies, as the absorber redshifts differ significantly from the quasar systemic redshifts. It is likely, then, that intrinsically the z_abs $\sim$ z_em DLA absorbers are the same as the intervening DLA absorbers, so that peculiarities in some of the z_abs $\sim$ z_em absorbers can be ascribed to their different environment i.e. proximity to the quasar, or membership of the same cluster as the quasar. We point out that the proximity effect may play some role, by reducing the Lyalpha -forest line blanketing of any Lyalpha emission line from z_abs $\sim$ z_em absorbers.

abstract = {We present broadband observations and analysis of Swift gamma-ray burst (GRB) 120119A. Our early-time afterglow detections began under 15 s after the burst in the host frame (redshift z = 1.73), and they yield constraints on the burst energetics and local environment. Late-time afterglow observations of the burst show evidence for a moderate column of dust (A_V $\sim$ 1.1 mag) similar to, but statistically distinct from, dust seen along Small Magellanic Cloud sightlines. Deep late-time observations reveal a dusty, rapidly star-forming host galaxy. Most notably, our early-time observations exhibit a significant red-to-blue colour change in the first $\sim$200 s after the trigger at levels heretofore unseen in GRB afterglows. This colour change, which is coincident with the final phases of the prompt emission, is a hallmark prediction of the photodestruction of dust in GRB afterglows. We test whether dust-destruction signatures are significantly distinct from other sources of colour change, namely a change in the intrinsic spectral index {\beta}. We find that a time-varying power-law spectrum alone cannot adequately describe the observed colour change, and allowing for dust destruction (via a time-varying A_V) significantly improves the fit. While not definitively ruling out other possibilities, this event provides the best support yet for the direct detection of dust destruction in the local environment of a GRB.},

Contemporaneously, DES performs a deep, time-domain survey in four optical bands (g,r,i,z) over 27 square degrees. DES exposures are processed nightly with an evolving data reduction pipeline and evaluated for image quality to determine if they need to be retaken. Difference imaging and transient source detection are also performed in the time domain component nightly. On a bi-annual basis, DES exposures are reprocessed with a refined pipeline and coadded to maximize imaging depth.

Using the SDSS image at $z<0.1$ and the HST image at $z>0.1$, we divided the galaxies into merger galaxies and non-merger galaxies with the morphological parameter asymmetry $A$, and quantified merging stages of galaxies based on the morphological indicators, the second-order momentum of the brightest 20$\%$ region $M_{20}$ and the Gini coefficient. We find that $M_{\rm PAH}/M_{\rm BG}$ of merger galaxies tend to be lower than that of non-merger galaxies and there are no systematic differences of $M_{\rm VSG}/M_{\rm BG}$ and $M_{\rm BG}/M_{\rm star}$ between merger galaxies and non-merger galaxies. We find that galaxies with very low $M_{\rm PAH}/M_{\rm BG}$ seem to be merger galaxies at late stages. These results suggest that PAHs are partly destroyed at late stages of merging processes. Furthermore, we investigated $M_{\rm PAH}/M_{\rm BG}$ variations in radiation field intensity strength $G_0$ and the emission line ratio of $[{\rm O\,{\scriptsize I}}]\lambda 6300/{\rm H}\alpha$ which is a shock tracer for merger galaxies and find that $M_{\rm PAH}/M_{\rm BG}$ decreases with increasing both $G_0$ and $[{\rm O\,{\scriptsize I}}]/{\rm H}\alpha$. PAH destruction is likely to be caused by two processes; strong radiation fields and large-scale shocks during merging processes of galaxies.},

abstract = {We present RAPID (Real-time Automated Photometric IDentification), a novel time-series classification tool capable of automatically identifying transients from within a day of the initial alert, to the full lifetime of a light curve. Using a deep recurrent neural network with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), we present the first method specifically designed to provide early classifications of astronomical time-series data, typing 12 different transient classes. Our classifier can process light curves with any phase coverage, and it does not rely on deriving computationally expensive features from the data, making RAPID well-suited for processing the millions of alerts that ongoing and upcoming wide-field surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will produce. The classification accuracy improves over the lifetime of the transient as more photometric data becomes available, and across the 12 transient classes, we obtain an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 and 0.98 at early and late epochs, respectively. We demonstrate RAPID's ability to effectively provide early classifications of observed transients from the ZTF data stream. We have made RAPID available as an open-source software package (https://astrorapid.readthedocs.io) for machine learning-based alert-brokers to use for the autonomous and quick classification of several thousand light curves within a few seconds.},

abstract = {Generally the gas metallicity in distant galaxies can only be inferred by using a few prominent emission lines. Various theoretical models have been used to predict the relationship between emission line fluxes and metallicity, suggesting that some line ratios can be used as diagnostics of the gas metallicity in galaxies. However, accurate empirical calibrations of these emission line flux ratios from real galaxy spectra spanning a wide metallicity range are still lacking. In this paper we provide such empirical calibrations by using the combination of two sets of spectroscopic data: one consisting of low-metallicity galaxies with a measurement of [OIII]4363, and the other one consisting of galaxies in the SDSS DR4 whose metallicity has been determined from various strong emission lines in their spectra. This combined data set constitutes the largest sample of galaxies with information on the gas metallicity available so far and spanning the widest metallicity range. Our empirical diagrams show that the line ratio [OIII]/[OII] is a useful tool to break the degeneracy in the R_23 parameter when no information on the [NII] line is available. The line ratio [NeIII]/[OII] also results to be a useful metallicity indicator for high-z galaxies. Finally, we compare these empirical relations with photoionization models. We find that the empirical R_23-metallicity sequence is strongly discrepant with respect to the trend expected by models with constant ionization parameter, which is interpreted as a consequence of a strong metallicity dependence of the average ionization parameter in galaxies. This result should warn about the use of theoretical models with constant ionization parameter to infer metallicities from observed line ratios. (abbreviated)},

abstract = {Two types of Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are observed: short duration hard spectrum GRBs and long duration soft spectrum GRBs. For many years long GRBs were the focus of intense research while the lack of observational data limited the study of short-hard GRBs (SHBs). In 2005 a breakthrough occurred following the first detections of SHB afterglows, longer wavelength emission that follows the burst of gamma-rays. Similarly to long GRBs, afterglow detections led to the identification of SHB host galaxies and measurement of their redshifts. These observations established that SHBs are cosmological relativistic sources that, unlike long GRBs, do not originate from the collapse of massive stars, and therefore constitute a distinct physical phenomenon. One viable model for SHB origin is the coalescence of compact binary systems (double neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole), in which case SHBs are the electromagnetic counterparts of strong gravitational-wave sources. The theoretical and observational study of SHBs following the recent pivotal discoveries is reviewed, along with new theoretical results that are presented here for the first time.},

abstract = {We use GALEX ultraviolet (UV) and optical integrated photometry of the hosts of seventeen luminous supernovae (LSNe, having peak M_V < -21) and compare them to a sample of 26,000 galaxies from a cross-match between the SDSS DR4 spectral catalog and GALEX interim release 1.1. We place the LSNe hosts on the galaxy NUV-r versus M_r color magnitude diagram (CMD) with the larger sample to illustrate how extreme they are. The LSN hosts appear to favor low-density regions of the galaxy CMD falling on the blue edge of the blue cloud toward the low luminosity end. From the UV-optical photometry, we estimate the star formation history of the LSN hosts. The hosts have moderately low star formation rates (SFRs) and low stellar masses (M_*) resulting in high specific star formation rates (sSFR). Compared with the larger sample, the LSN hosts occupy low-density regions of a diagram plotting sSFR versus M_* in the area having higher sSFR and lower M_*. This preference for low M_*, high sSFR hosts implies the LSNe are produced by an effect having to do with their local environment. The correlation of mass with metallicity suggests that perhaps wind-driven mass loss is the factor that prevents LSNe from arising in higher-mass, higher-metallicity hosts. The massive progenitors of the LSNe (>100 M_sun), by appearing in low-SFR hosts, are potential tests for theories of the initial mass function that limit the maximum mass of a star based on the SFR.},

abstract = {We use multi-wavelength, matched aperture, integrated photometry from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX), the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and the RC3 to estimate the physical properties of 166 nearby galaxies hosting 168 well-observed Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The ultraviolet (UV) imaging of local SN Ia hosts from GALEX allows a direct comparison with higher-redshift hosts measured at optical wavelengths that correspond to the rest-frame UV. Our data corroborate well-known features that have been seen in other SN Ia samples. Specifically, hosts with active star formation produce brighter and slower SNe Ia on average, and hosts with luminosity-weighted ages older than 1 Gyr produce on average more faint, fast, and fewer bright, slow SNe Ia than younger hosts. New results include that in our sample, the faintest and fastest SNe Ia occur only in galaxies exceeding a stellar mass threshold of ∼1010 M ⊙, leading us to conclude that their progenitors must arise in populations that are older and/or more metal rich than the general SN Ia population. A low host extinction subsample hints at a residual trend in peak luminosity with host age, after correcting for light-curve shape, giving the appearance that older hosts produce less-extincted SNe Ia on average. This has implications for cosmological fitting of SNe Ia, and suggests that host age could be useful as a parameter in the fitting. Converting host mass to metallicity and computing 56Ni mass from the supernova light curves, we find that our local sample is consistent with a model that predicts a shallow trend between stellar metallicity and the 56Ni mass that powers the explosion, but we cannot rule out the absence of a trend. We measure a correlation between 56Ni mass and host age in the local universe that is shallower and not as significant as that seen at higher redshifts. The details of the age-56Ni mass correlations at low and higher redshift imply a luminosity-weighted age threshold of ∼3 Gyr for SN Ia hosts, above which they are less likely to produce SNe Ia with 56Ni masses above ∼0.5 M ⊙. {\textcopyright} 2009.

abstract = {The Dark Energy Survey is a stage III dark energy experiment, performing an optical imaging survey to measure cosmological equation of state parameters using four independent methods. The scope and complexity of the survey introduced complex strategic and tactical scheduling problems that needed to be addressed. We begin with an overview of the process used to develop DES strategy and tactics, from the inception of the project, to task forces that studied and developed strategy changes over the course of the survey, to the nightly pre-observing meeting in which immediate tactical issues were addressed. We then summarize the strategic choices made for each sub-survey, including metrics, scheduling considerations, choice of time domain fields and their sequences of exposures, and wide survey footprint and pointing layout choices. We go on to describe the detailed process that determined which specific exposures were taken at which specific times. We give a chronology of the strategic and tactical peculiarities of each year of observing, including the proposal and execution of a sixth year. We give an overview of obstac, the implementation of the DES scheduler used to simulate and evaluate strategic and tactical options, and automate exposure scheduling; and describe developments in obstac for use after DES. Appendices describe further details of data quality evaluation, tau, and t_eff; airmass calculation; and modeling of the seeing and sky brightness. The significant corpus of DES data indicates that the simple scaling relations for seeing as a function of wavelength and airmass derived from the Kolmogorov turbulence model work adequately for exposure planning purposes: deviations from these relations are modest in comparison with short time-scale seeing variations.},

abstract = {We investigate the nature of gas accretion onto haloes and galaxies at z=2 using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations run with the moving mesh code AREPO. Implementing a Monte Carlo tracer particle scheme to determine the origin and thermodynamic history of accreting gas, we make quantitative comparisons to an otherwise identical simulation run with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code GADGET-3. Contrasting these two numerical approaches, we find significant physical differences in the thermodynamic history of accreted gas in haloes above 10^10.5 solar masses. In agreement with previous work, GADGET simulations show a cold fraction near unity for galaxies forming in massive haloes, implying that only a small percentage of accreted gas heats to an appreciable fraction of the virial temperature during accretion. The same galaxies in AREPO show a much lower cold fraction, <20% in haloes above 10^11 solar masses. This results from a hot gas accretion rate which, at this same halo mass, is an order of magnitude larger than with GADGET, while the cold accretion rate is also lower. These discrepancies increase for more massive systems, and we explain both as due to numerical inaccuracies in the standard formulation of SPH. We also observe that the relatively sharp transition from cold to hot mode dominated accretion, at a halo mass of $\sim$10^11, is a consequence of comparing past gas temperatures to a constant threshold value independent of virial temperature. Examining the spatial distribution of accreting gas, we find that gas filaments in GADGET tend to remain collimated and flow coherently to small radii, or artificially fragment and form a large number of purely numerical "blobs". Similar gas streams in AREPO show increased heating and disruption at 0.25-0.5 virial radii and contribute to the hot gas accretion rate in a manner distinct from classical cooling flows.},

abstract = {The localization of the repeating fast radio burst (FRB) 121102 to a low-metallicity dwarf galaxy at z=0.193, and its association with a luminous quiescent radio source, suggests the possibility that FRBs originate from magnetars, formed by the unusual supernovae that occur in such galaxies. We investigate this possibility via a comparison of magnetar birth rates, the FRB volumetric rate, and host galaxy demographics. We calculate average volumetric rates of possible millisecond magnetar production channels, such as superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), long and short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and general magnetar production via core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). For each channel, we also explore the expected host galaxy demographics using their known properties. We determine for the first time the number density of FRB emitters (the product of their volumetric birth rate and lifetime), R 10 FRB 4 t » Gpc −3 , assuming that FRBs are predominantly emitted from repetitive sources similar to FRB121102 and adopting a beaming factor of 0.1. By comparing rates, we find that production via rare channels (SLSNe, GRBs) implies a typical FRB lifetime of ∼30–300years, in good agreement with other lines of argument. The total energy emitted over this time is consistent with the available energy stored in the magnetic field. On the other hand, any relation to magnetars produced via normal CCSNe leads to a very short lifetime of ∼0.5years, in conflict with both theory and observation. We demonstrate that due to the diverse host galaxy distributions of the different progenitor channels, many possible sources of FRB birth can be ruled out with 10  host galaxy identifications. Conversely, targeted searches of galaxies that have previously hosted decades-old SLSNe and GRBs may be a fruitful strategy for discovering new FRBs and related quiescent radio sources, and determining the nature of their progenitors.},

We fit the spectral template that minimizes the colour dispersion in SNe Ia, as measured through UBVRI photometry of near-by supernovae. A clear colour dependence upon lightcurve shape is found, with the narrower lightcurves being redder up to about one month past lightcurve maximum. We also derive an average reddening law, after correcting for lightcurve shape differences in intrinsic colour, that is well described by a Cardelli, Clayton & Mathis law with R_V=1.75 \pm 0.27 for 80 Type Ia supernovae with E(B-V) < 0.7 mag. A subset sample including 69 SNe with modest reddening, E(B-V)<0.25 mag, yields a significantly smaller value, R_V $\sim$ 1, suggesting that the observed reddening of Type Ia supernovae may have a more complex origin, perhaps involving other processes beside extinction by interstellar dust in the host galaxy.},

For 2905 field galaxies, complete to 10^10(10^10.8) Msun at z<0.7(1), with Keck spectroscopic redshifts out to z=1.1, we compile SF rates (SFR) from emission lines, GALEX, and Spitzer MIPS 24 micron photometry, optical-NIR M* measurements, and HST morphologies. Galaxies with reliable signs of SF form a distinct "main sequence (MS)", with a limited range of SFR at a given M* and z (1 sigma < +-0.3 dex), and log(SFR) approximately proportional to log(M*). The range of log(SFR) remains constant to z>1, while the MS as a whole moves to higher SFR as z increases. The range of SFR along the MS constrains the amplitude of episodic variations of SF, and the effect of mergers on SFR. Typical galaxies spend $\sim$67(95)% of their lifetime since z=1 within a factor of <$\sim$ 2(4) of their average SFR at a given M* and z. The dominant mode of the evolution of SF since z$\sim$1 is apparently a gradual decline of the average SFR in most individual galaxies, not a decreasing frequency of starburst episodes, or a decreasing factor by which SFR are enhanced in starbursts. LIRGs at z$\sim$1 seem to mostly reflect the high SFR typical for massive galaxies at that epoch. The smooth MS may reflect that the same set of few physical processes governs star formation prior to additional quenching processes. A gradual process like gas exhaustion may play a dominant role.},

Here, we present the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) integral field spectroscopy follow-up of this quasi-stellar object (QSO). Our primary goal is to characterize this LAB in detail by mapping it both spatially and spectrally using the Ly$\alpha$ line, and by looking for high-ionization lines to constrain the emission mechanism. Combining the high sensitivity of the MUSE integral field spectrograph mounted on the Yepun telescope at ESO-VLT with the natural coronograph provided by the PDLA, we map the LAB down to the QSO position, after robust subtraction of QSO light in the spectral domain. In addition to confirming earlier results for the small bright component of the LAB, we unveil a faint filamentary emission protruding to the south over about 80 pkpc (physical kpc); this results in a total size of about 120 pkpc. We derive the velocity field of the LAB (assuming no transfer effects) and map the Ly$\alpha$ line width. Upper limits are set to the flux of the N v $\lambda$1238 − 1242, C iv $\lambda$1548 − 1551, He ii $\lambda$1640, and C iii] $\lambda$1548 − 1551 lines. We have discovered two probable Ly$\alpha$ emitters at the same redshift as the LAB and at projected distances of 265 kpc and 207 kpc from the QSO; their Ly$\alpha$ luminosities might well be enhanced by the QSO radiation. We also find an emission line galaxy at z = 0.33 near the line of sight to the QSO. This LAB shares the same general characteristics as the 17 others surrounding radio-quiet QSOs presented previously. However, there are indications that it may be centered on the PDLA galaxy rather than on the QSO.},

abstract = {We present the results of a survey for super Lyman limit systems (SLLS; defined to be absorbers with 19.0 <= log(NHI) <= 20.3 cm^-2) from a large sample of high resolution spectra acquired using the Keck and Magellan telescopes. Specifically, we present 47 new SLLS from 113 QSO sightlines. We focus on the neutral hydrogen frequency distribution f(N,X) of the SLLS and its moments, and compare these results with the Lyman-alpha forest and the damped Lyman alpha systems (DLA; absorbers with log(NHI) >= 20.3 cm^-2). We find that that f(N,X) of the SLLS can be reasonably described with a power-law of index alpha = -1.43^{+0.15}_{-0.16} or alpha = -1.19^{+0.20}_{-0.21} depending on whether we set the lower N(HI) bound for the analysis at 10^{19.0} cm^-2 or 10^{19.3}$ cm^-2, respectively. The results indicate a flattening in the slope of f(N,X) between the SLLS and DLA. We find little evidence for redshift evolution in the shape of f(N,X) for the SLLS over the redshift range of the sample 1.68 < z < 4.47 and only tentative evidence for evolution in the zeroth moment of f(N,X), the line density l_lls(X). We introduce the observable distribution function O(N,X) and its moment, which elucidates comparisons of HI absorbers from the Lyman-alpha through to the DLA. We find that a simple three parameter function can fit O(N,X) over the range 17.0 <= log(NHI) <=22.0. We use these results to predict that f(N,X) must show two additional inflections below the SLLS regime to match the observed f(N,X) distribution of the Lyman-alpha forest. Finally, we demonstrate that SLLS contribute a minor fraction (\sim15%) of the universe's hydrogen atoms and, therefore, an even small fraction of the mass in predominantly neutral gas.},

One possibility is that there is some property of the central engine, outflow or external medium that affects the rate of energy release so that the bright afterglows release their energy more quickly and decay faster than the fainter afterglows. Alternatively, the correlation may be produced by variation of the observer's viewing angle, with observers at large viewing angles observing fainter and slower decaying light curves.},

abstract = {(abridged) The physics of diffuse gas accretion and the properties of the cold and hot modes of accretion onto proto-galaxies between z=2 and z=5.4 is investigated using the large cosmological simulation performed with the RAMSES code on the MareNostrum supercomputing facility. Galactic winds, chemical enrichment, UV background heating and radiative cooling are taken into account in this very high resolution simulation. Using accretion--weighted temperature histograms, we have perfomed two different measurements of the thermal state of the gas accreted towards the central galaxy. The first measurement, performed using accretion--weighted histograms on a spherical surface of radius 0.2 Rvir centred on the densest gas structure near the halo centre of mass, is a good indicator of the presence of an accretion shock in the vicinity of the galactic disc. We define the hot shock mass, Mshock, as the typical halo mass separating cold dominated from hot dominated accretion in the vicinity of the galaxy. The second measurement is performed by radially averaging histograms between 0.2 Rvir and Rvir, in order to detect radially extended structures such as gas filaments: this is a good proxy for detecting cold streams feeding the central galaxy. We define Mstream as the transition mass separating cold dominated from hot dominated accretion in the outer halo, marking the disappearance of these cold streams. We find a hot shock transition mass of Mshock=10^{11.6} Msun (dark matter), with no significant evolution with redshift. Conversely, we find that Mstream increases sharply with z. Our measurements are in agreement with the analytical predictions of Birnboim & Dekel (2003) and Dekel & Birnboim (2006), if we correct their model by assuming low metallicity (< 10^{-3} Zsun) for the filaments, correspondingly to our measurements.},

@article{Oppenheimer2009,
abstract = {We analyse cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that include observationally-constrained prescriptions for galactic outflows. If these simulated winds accurately represent winds in the real Universe, then material previously ejected in winds provides the dominant source of gas infall for new star formation at redshifts z<1. This recycled wind accretion, or wind mode, provides a third physically distinct accretion channel in addition to the "hot" and "cold" modes emphasised in recent theoretical studies. Because of the interaction between outflows and gas in and around halos, the recycling timescale of wind material (t_rec) is shorter in higher-mass systems, which reside in denser gaseous environments. In these simulations, this differential recycling plays a central role in shaping the present-day galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF). If we remove all particles that were ever ejected in a wind, then the predicted GSMFs are much steeper than observed; galaxy masses are suppressed both by the direct removal of gas and by the hydrodynamic heating of their surroundings, which reduces subsequent infall. With wind recycling included, the simulation that incorporates our favoured momentum-driven wind scalings reproduces the observed GSMF for stellar masses 10^9 < M < 5x10^10 Msolar. At higher masses, wind recycling leads to excessive galaxy masses and excessive star formation rates relative to observations. In these massive systems, some quenching mechanism must suppress the re-accretion of gas ejected from star-forming galaxies. In short, as has long been anticipated, the form of the GSMF is governed by outflows; the unexpected twist here for our simulated winds is that it is not primarily the ejection of material but how the ejected material is re-accreted that governs the GSMF.},

abstract = {GRB 080810 was one of the first bursts to trigger both Swift and the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. It was subsequently monitored over the X-ray and UV/optical bands by Swift, in the optical by ROTSE and a host of other telescopes and was detected in the radio by the VLA. The redshift of z= 3.355 +/- 0.005 was determined by Keck/HIRES and confirmed by RTT150 and NOT. The prompt gamma/X-ray emission, detected over 0.3-10^3 keV, systematically softens over time, with E_peak moving from $\sim$600 keV at the start to $\sim$40 keV around 100 s after the trigger; alternatively, this spectral evolution could be identified with the blackbody temperature of a quasithermal model shifting from $\sim$60 keV to $\sim$3 keV over the same time interval. The first optical detection was made at 38 s, but the smooth, featureless profile of the full optical coverage implies that this originated from the afterglow component, not the pulsed/flaring prompt emission.   Broadband optical and X-ray coverage of the afterglow at the start of the final X-ray decay ($\sim$8 ks) reveals a spectral break between the optical and X-ray bands in the range 10^15 - 2x10^16 Hz. The decay profiles of the X-ray and optical bands show that this break initially migrates blueward to this frequency and then subsequently drifts redward to below the optical band by $\sim$3x10^5 s. GRB 080810 was very energetic, with an isotropic energy output for the prompt component of 3x10^53 erg and 1.6x10^52 erg for the afterglow; there is no evidence for a jet break in the afterglow up to six days following the burst.},

@article{Palmerio2019,
abstract = {Aims. Long gamma-ray bursts (LGRB) have been proposed as promising tracers of star formation owing to their association with the core-collapse of massive stars. Nonetheless, previous studies we carried out at z < 1 support the hypothesis that the conditions necessary for the progenitor star to produce an LGRB (e.g. low metallicity), were challenging the use of LGRBs as star-formation tracers, at least at low redshift. The goal of this work is to characterise the population of host galaxies of LGRBs at 1 < z < 2, investigate the conditions in which LGRBs form at these redshifts and assess their use as tracers of star formation. Methods. We performed a spectro-photometric analysis to determine the stellar mass, star formation rate, specific star formation rate and metallicity of the complete, unbiased host galaxy sample of the Swift/BAT6 LGRB sample at 1 < z < 2. We compared the distribution of these properties to the ones of typical star-forming galaxies from the MOSDEF and COSMOS2015 Ultra Deep surveys, within the same redshift range. Results. We find that, similarly to z < 1, LGRBs do not directly trace star formation at 1 < z < 2, and they tend to avoid high-mass, high-metallicity host galaxies. We also find evidence for an enhanced fraction of starbursts among the LGRB host sample with respect to the star-forming population of galaxies. Nonetheless we demonstrate that the driving factor ruling the LGRB efficiency is metallicity. The LGRB host distributions can be reconciled with the ones expected from galaxy surveys by imposing a metallicity upper limit of logOH ∼ 8.55. We can determine upper limits on the fraction of super-solar metallicity LGRB host galaxies of ∼20%, 10% at z < 1, 1 < z < 2, respectively. Conclusions. Metallicity rules the LGRB production efficiency, which is stifled at Z{\^{a}}‰³ 0.7 Z{\textperiodcentered}. Under this hypothesis we can expect LGRBs to trace star formation at z > 3, once the bulk of the star forming galaxy population are characterised by metallicities below this limit. The role played by metallicity can be explained by the conditions necessary for the progenitor star to produce an LGRB. The moderately high metallicity threshold found is in agreement with the conditions necessary to rapidly produce a fast-rotating Wolf-Rayet stars in close binary systems, and could be accommodated by single star models under chemically homogeneous mixing with very rapid rotation and weak magnetic coupling.},

abstract = {We introduce a galaxy cluster mass observable, µ , based on the stellar masses of cluster members, and we present results for the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 1 observations. Stellar masses are computed using a Bayesian Model Averaging method, and are validated for DES data using simulations and COSMOS data. We show that µ works as a promising mass proxy by comparing our predictions to X-ray measurements. We measure the X-ray temperature-µ relation for a total of 129 clusters matched between the wide-field DES Year 1 redMaPPer catalogue and Chandra and XMM archival observations, spanning the redshift range 0.1 < z < 0.7. For a scaling relation which is linear in logarithmic space, we find a slope of $\alpha$ = 0.488 ± 0.043 and a scatter in the X-ray temperature at fixed µ of $\sigma$ lnT X |µ = 0.266 +0.019 −0.020 for the joint sample. By using the halo mass scaling relations of the X-ray temperature from the Weighing the Giants program, we further derive the µ-conditioned scatter in mass, finding $\sigma$ lnM |µ = 0.26 +0.15 −0.10. These results are competitive with well-established cluster mass proxies used for cosmological analyses, showing that µ can be used as a reliable and physically motivated mass proxy to derive cosmological constraints.},

abstract = {We analyse spectroscopic measurements of 122 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) with z < 0.09 discovered by the Palomar Transient Factory, focusing on the properties of the Si II $\lambda$6355 and Ca II 'near-infrared triplet' absorptions. We examine the velocities of the photospheric Si II $\lambda$6355, and the velocities and strengths of the photospheric and high-velocity Ca II, in the context of the stellar mass (M stellar) and star formation rate (SFR) of the SN host galaxies, as well as the position of the SN within its host. We find that SNe Ia with faster Si II $\lambda$6355 tend to explode in more massive galaxies, with the highest velocity events only occurring in galaxies with M stellar > 3 × 10 9 M . We also find some evidence that these highest velocity SNe Ia explode in the inner regions of their host galaxies, similar to the study of Wang et al., although the trend is not as significant in our data. We show that these trends are consistent with some SN Ia spectral models, if the host galaxy stellar mass is interpreted as a proxy for host galaxy metallicity. We study the strength of the high-velocity component of the Ca II near-IR absorption, and show that SNe Ia with stronger high-velocity components relative to photospheric components are hosted by galaxies with low M stellar , blue colour, and a high sSFR. Such SNe are therefore likely to arise from the youngest progenitor systems. This argues against a pure orientation effect being responsible for high-velocity features in SN Ia spectra and, when combined with other studies, is consistent with a scenario where high-velocity features are related to an interaction between the SN ejecta and circumstellar medium local to the SN.},

We determine star formation rates, gas-phase/stellar metallicities, and stellar masses and ages of these objects. As expected, strong correlations between the SN Ia light-curve width (stretch) and the host age/mass/metallicity are found: fainter, faster declining events tend to be hosted by older/massive/metal-rich galax-ies. There is some evidence that redder SNe Ia explode in higher metallicity galaxies, but we found no relation between the SN colour and host galaxy extinction based on the Balmer decrement, suggesting that the colour variation of these SNe does not primarily arise from this source. SNe Ia in higher mass/metallicity galaxies also appear brighter after stretch/colour corrections than their counterparts in lower mass hosts, and the stronger correlation is with gas-phase metallicity suggesting this may be the more important variable. We also compared the host stellar mass distribution to that in galaxy-targeted SN surveys and the high-redshift untargeted Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS). SNLS has many more low-mass galaxies, while the targeted searches have fewer. This can be explained by an evolution in the galaxy stellar mass function, coupled with an SN delay-time distribution proportional to t −1 . Finally, we},

abstract = { I report here centimeter–wavelength observations carried out at the Very Large Array (VLA) to help resolve two questions. First, what is the source of the far infrared (FIR) emission in infrared-luminous IRAS galaxies, active nuclei or more widely distributed star formation? And what physics underlies the tight correlation (Helou et al. , 1985) between FIR and radio flux? To test potential answers to these questions, we believe it is important to study the most luminous IRAS galaxies. We selected 39 for study from the ultraluminous catalog of Strauss et al. (1990 and 1992). All sources had FIR luminosity ≥ 10 11.4 L ⊙ . Radio wavelength observations of these systems provide several advantages. First, in the radio there is no obscuration, so we can “see” the active galactic nuclei, if present. Radio spectral indices can distinguish between synchrotron and thermal emission. And finally, observations at the VLA provide sub–kpc resolution. We observed these sources with the VLA in its C configuration. At 1460 MHz, the effective resolution was ≃ 15″; and ≃ 4″ at 4860 MHz. We made follow-up observations on 24 sources in the A configuration with resolution at 4860 MHz of ≃ 0″.5 (or 300–800 h –1 pc for these sources). },

In this review, I describe the most recent observational results and the current theoretical interpretation. Observationally, a major development is the rise of time-resolved spectral analysis. These led to (I) identification of a distinguished high energy component, with GeV photons often seen at a delay; and (II) firm evidence for the existence of a photospheric (thermal) component in a large number of bursts. These results triggered many theoretical efforts aimed at understanding the physical conditions in the inner jet regions from which the prompt photons are emitted, as well as the spectral diversity observed. I highlight some areas of active theoretical research. These include: (I) understanding the role played by magnetic fields in shaping the dynamics of GRB outflow and spectra; (II) understanding the microphysics of kinetic and magnetic energy transfer, namely accelerating particle to high energies in both shock waves and magnetic reconnection layers; (III) understanding how sub-photospheric energy dissipation broadens the "Planck" spectrum; and (IV) geometrical light aberration effects. I highlight some of these efforts, and point towards gaps that still exist in our knowledge as well as promising directions for the future.},

abstract = {Using spectroscopically selected galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey we present a detection of reddening due to dust in the circumgalactic medium of galaxies. We detect the mean change in the colors of "standard crayons" correlated with the presence of foreground galaxies at z $\sim$0.05 as a function of angular separation. Following Peek & Graves (2010), we create standard crayons using passively evolving galaxies corrected for Milky Way reddening and color-redshift trends, leading to a sample with as little as 2% scatter in color. We devise methods to ameliorate possible systematic effects related to the estimation of colors, and we find an excess reddening induced by foreground galaxies at a level ranging from 10 to 0.5 millimagnitudes on scales ranging from 30 kpc to 1 Mpc. We attribute this effect to a large-scale distribution of dust around galaxies similar to the findings of Menard et al. 2010. We find that circumgalactic reddening is a weak function of stellar mass over the range $6 \times 10^9 M_\odot$ -- $6 \times 10^{10} M_\odot$ and note that this behavior appears to be consistent with recent results on the distribution of metals in the gas phase.},

abstract = {We present a budget and accounting of metals in and around star-forming galaxies at $z\sim 0$. We combine empirically derived star formation histories with updated supernova and AGB yields and rates to estimate the total mass of metals produced by galaxies with present-day stellar mass of $10^{9.3}$--$10^{11.6} M_{\odot}$. On the accounting side of the ledger, we show that a surprisingly constant 20--25% mass fraction of produced metals remain in galaxies' stars, interstellar gas and interstellar dust, with little dependence of this fraction on the galaxy stellar mass (omitting those metals immediately locked up in remnants). Thus, the bulk of metals are outside of galaxies, produced in the progenitors of today's $L^*$ galaxies. The COS-Halos survey is uniquely able to measure the mass of metals in the circumgalactic medium (to impact parameters of $< 150$ kpc) of low-redshift $\sim L^*$ galaxies. Using these data, we map the distribution of CGM metals as traced by both the highly ionized OVI ion and a suite of low-ionization species; combined with constraints on circumgalactic dust and hotter X-ray emitting gas out to similar impact parameters, we show that $\sim 40$% of metals produced by $M_{\star}\sim 10^{10}M_{\odot}$ galaxies can be easily accounted for out to 150 kpc. With the current data, we cannot rule out a constant mass of metals within this fixed physical radius. This census provides a crucial boundary condition for the eventual fate of metals in galaxy evolution models.},

As such, these features trace the FUV stellar flux and are\nthus a measure of star formation. We examined the IR spectral\ncharacteristics of Galactic massive star-forming regions and of normal\nand starburst galaxies, as well as active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and\nultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). The goal of this study is to\nanalyze whether PAH features are a good qualitative and/or quantitative\ntracer of star formation, and hence to evaluate the application of PAH\nemission as a diagnostic tool in order to identify the dominant\nprocesses contributing to the infrared emission from Seyfert galaxies\nand ULIRGs. We develop a new mid-infrared (MIR)/far-infrared (FIR)\ndiagnostic diagram based on our Galactic sample and compare it to the\ndiagnostic tools of Genzel and coworkers and Laurent and coworkers, with\nthese diagnostic tools also applied to our Galactic sample. This MIR/FIR\ndiagnostic is derived from the FIR normalized 6.2 {$\mu$}m PAH flux and the\nFIR normalized 6.2 {$\mu$}m continuum flux. Within this diagram, the\nGalactic sources form a sequence spanning a range of 3 orders of\nmagnitude in these ratios, ranging from embedded compact H II regions to\nexposed photodissociation regions (PDRs) and the (diffuse) interstellar\nmedium (ISM). However, the variation in the 6.2 {$\mu$}m PAH\nfeature-to-continuum ratio is relative small. Comparison of our\nextragalactic sample with our Galactic sources revealed an excellent\nresemblance of normal and starburst galaxies to exposed PDRs. While\nSeyfert 2 galaxies coincide with the starburst trend, Seyfert 1 galaxies\nare displaced by at least a factor of 10 in 6.2 {$\mu$}m continuum flux, in\naccordance with general orientation-dependent unification schemes for\nAGNs. ULIRGs show a diverse spectral appearance. Some show a typical AGN\nhot dust continuum. More, however, either are starburst-like or show\nsigns of strong dust obscuration in the nucleus. One characteristic of\nthe ULIRGs also seems to be the presence of more prominent FIR emission\nthan either starburst galaxies or AGNs. We discuss the observed\nvariation in the Galactic sample in view of the evolutionary state and\nthe PAH/dust abundance and discuss the use of PAHs as quantitative\ntracers of star formation activity. Based on these investigations, we\nfind that PAHs may be better suited as a tracer of B stars, which\ndominate the Galactic stellar energy budget, than as a tracer of massive\nstar formation (O stars).\n},

To this inquiry, we extend the graphite-silicate grain model, introduced by Mathis, Rumpl, and Nordsieck and developed by Draine and Lee (1984) from the Milky Way to the Magellanic Clouds. We find that the empirical extinction curves in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds can be reproduced by adjusting only the relative abundances of graphite and silicate grains, while leaving all other model properties fixed to those appropriate for the Galactic extinction curve. Using the graphite-silicate models, we calculate the absorption and scattering optical depths, the mass-density ratio of interstellar dust to neutral hydrogen, and the Kramers-Kronig relation for all three galaxies. We also present a fitting function for the three extinction curves, valid not only over the observed range of wavelengths but also over the full range as predicted by the models. All the quantities we derived here are independent of the dust-to-gas ratios in the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds, and can be applied to other galaxies if they contain Galactic or Magellanic-type dust.},

abstract = {The known host galaxies of short-hard gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) to date are characterized by low to moderate star formation rates (SFRs) and a broad range of stellar masses, in general agreement with models associating the phenomenon with an old progenitor, such as merging neutron stars. In this paper, we positionally associate the recent unambiguously short-hard Swift GRB 100206A with a disk galaxy at redshift z = 0.4068 that is rapidly forming stars at a rate of ∼30 M yr −1 , almost an order of magnitude higher than any previously identified short-GRB host. The galaxy is very red (g − K = 4.3 AB mag), heavily obscured (A V ≈ 2 mag), and has the highest metallicity of any GRB host to date (12 + log[O/H] KD02 = 9.2): it is a classical luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG), with L IR ≈ 4 × 10 11 L . While these properties could be interpreted to support an association of this GRB with recent star formation, modeling of the broadband spectral energy distribution also indicates that a substantial stellar mass of mostly older stars is also present. The specific SFR is modest (sSFR ≈ 0.5 Gyr −1), the current SFR is not substantially elevated above its long-term average, and the host morphology shows no sign of recent merger activity. Our observations are therefore equally consistent with an older progenitor. Given the precedent established by previous short-GRB hosts and the significant fraction of the universe's stellar mass in LIRG-like systems at z 0.3, an older progenitor represents the most likely origin of this event.},

abstract = {We report on observations of a gamma-ray burst (GRB 061126) with an extremely bright (R $\sim$ 12 mag at peak) early-time optical afterglow. The optical afterglow is already fading as a power law 22 seconds after the trigger, with no detectable prompt contribution in our first exposure, which was coincident with a large prompt-emission gamma-ray pulse. The optical--infrared photometric spectral energy distribution is an excellent fit to a power law, but it exhibits a moderate red-to-blue evolution in the spectral index at about 500 s after the burst. This color change is contemporaneous with a switch from a relatively fast decay to slower decay. The rapidly decaying early afterglow is broadly consistent with synchrotron emission from a reverse shock, but a bright forward-shock component predicted by the intermediate- to late-time X-ray observations under the assumptions of standard afterglow models is not observed. Indeed, despite its remarkable early-time brightness, this burst would qualify as a dark burst at later times on the basis of its nearly flat optical-to-X-ray spectral index. Our photometric spectral energy distribution provides no evidence of host-galaxy extinction, requiring either large quantities of grey dust in the host system (at redshift 1.1588 +/- 0.0006, based upon our late-time Keck spectroscopy) or separate physical origins for the X-ray and optical afterglows.},

abstract = {We present multiwavelength observations of the afterglow of GRB 130427A, the brightest (in total fluence) gamma-ray burst of the past 29 years. Optical spectroscopy from Gemini-North reveals the redshift of the GRB to be z=0.340, indicating that its unprecedented brightness is primarily the result of its relatively close proximity to Earth; the intrinsic luminosities of both the GRB and its afterglow are not extreme in comparison to other bright GRBs. We present a large suite of multiwavelength observations spanning from 300 s to 130 d after the burst and demonstrate that the afterglow shows relatively simple, smooth evolution at all frequencies with no significant late-time flaring or rebrightening activity. The entire dataset from 1 GHz to 10 GeV can be modeled as synchrotron emission from a combination of reverse and forward shocks in good agreement with the standard afterglow model, providing strong support to the applicability of the underlying theory and clarifying the nature of the GeV emission observed to last for minutes to hours following other very bright GRBs. A tenuous, wind-stratified circumburst density profile is required by the observations, suggesting a massive-star progenitor with a low mass-loss rate, perhaps due to low metallicity. GRBs similar in nature to GRB 130427A, inhabiting low-density media and exhibiting strong reverse shocks, are probably not uncommon but may have been difficult to recognize in the past due to their relatively faint late-time radio emission; more such events should be found in abundance by the new generation of sensitive radio and millimeter instruments.},

abstract = {We present observations and analysis of the host galaxies of 23 heavily dust-obscured gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) observed by the Swift satellite during the years 2005-2009, representing all GRBs with an unambiguous host-frame extinction of A_V>1 mag from this period. Deep observations with Keck, Gemini, VLT, HST, and Spitzer successfully detect the host galaxies and establish spectroscopic or photometric redshifts for all 23 events, enabling us to provide measurements of the intrinsic host star-formation rates, stellar masses, and mean extinctions. Compared to the hosts of unobscured GRBs at similar redshifts, we find that the hosts of dust-obscured GRBs are (on average) more massive by about an order of magnitude and also more rapidly star-forming and dust-obscured. While this demonstrates that GRBs populate all types of star-forming galaxies including the most massive, luminous systems at z$\sim$2, at redshifts below 1.5 the overall GRB population continues to show a highly significant aversion away from massive galaxies and a preference for low-mass systems relative to what would be expected given a purely SFR-selected galaxy sample. This supports the notion that the GRB rate is strongly dependent on metallicity, and may suggest that the most massive galaxies in the Universe underwent a transition in their chemical properties $\sim$9 Gyr ago. We also conclude that, based on the absence of unobscured GRBs in massive galaxies and the absence of obscured GRBs in low-mass galaxies, the dust distributions of the lowest-mass and the highest-mass galaxies are relatively homogeneous, while intermediate-mass galaxies ($\sim$10^9 M_sun) have diverse internal properties.},

abstract = {Luminous infrared galaxies and submillimeter galaxies contribute significantly to stellar mass assembly and the frequency of GRBs in these systems provides an important test of the connection between the gamma-ray burst rate and that of overall cosmic star-formation. We present sensitive 3 GHz radio observations using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array of 31 uniformly-selected GRB host galaxies spanning a redshift range from 0 < z < 2.5, providing the first fully dust- and sample-unbiased measurement of the fraction of GRBs originating from the Universe's most bolometrically luminous galaxies. Four galaxies are detected, with inferred radio star-formation rates ranging between 50-300 Msun/yr. Three of the four detections correspond to events consistent with being optically-obscured "dark" bursts. Our overall detection fraction implies that between 5-25% of GRBs between 0.5 < z < 2.5 occur in galaxies with S_3GHz > 10 uJy, corresponding to SFR > 50 Msun/yr at z$\sim$1 or > 250 Msun/yr at z$\sim$2. Similar galaxies contribute approximately 10-30% of all cosmic star-formation, so our results are consistent with a GRB rate which is not strongly biased with respect to the total star-formation rate of a galaxy. However, all four radio-detected hosts have modest stellar masses ($\sim$few x 10^10 Msun), significantly lower than IR/submillimeter-selected field galaxies of similar luminosities. We suggest that GRBs may be suppressed in metal-rich environments but independently are enhanced in intense starbursts, producing a strong efficiency dependence on mass but little net dependence on bulk galaxy star-formation rate.},

We find strong evolution in the host luminosity distribution between z$\sim$0.5 (median absolute NIR AB magnitude $\sim$ -18.5, corresponding to M* $\sim$ 3x10^8 M_sun and z$\sim$1.5), but negligible variation between z$\sim$1.5 and z$\sim$5 (median magnitude $\sim$ -21.2, corresponding to M* $\sim$ 5x10^9 M_sun). Dust-obscured GRBs dominate the massive host population but are only rarely seen associated with low-mass hosts, indicating that massive star-forming galaxies are universally and (to some extent) homogeneously dusty at high-redshift while low-mass star-forming galaxies retain little dust in their ISM. Comparing our luminosity distributions to field surveys and measurements of the high-z mass-metallicity relation, our results have good consistency with a model in which the GRB rate per unit star-formation is constant in galaxies with gas-phase metallicity below approximately the Solar value but heavily suppressed in more metal-rich environments. This model also naturally explains the previously-reported "excess" in the GRB rate beyond z>2; metals stifle GRB production in most galaxies at z<1.5 but have only minor impact at higher redshifts. The metallicity threshold we infer is much higher than predicted by single-star models and favors a binary progenitor. Our observations also constrain the fraction of cosmic star-formation in low-mass galaxies undetectable to Spitzer to be a small minority at most redshifts ($\sim$10% at z$\sim$2, $\sim$25% at z$\sim$3, and $\sim$50% at z=3.5-6.0).},

abstract = {We present observations and analysis of the broad-band afterglow of Swift GRB071025. Using optical and infrared (RIYJHK) photometry, we derive a photometric redshift of 4.4 < z < 5.2; at this redshift our simultaneous multicolour observations begin at ∼30 s after the gamma-ray burst trigger in the host frame, during the initial rising phase of the afterglow. We associate the light-curve peak at ∼580 s in the observer frame with the formation of the forward shock, giving an estimate of the initial Lorentz factor 0 ∼ 200. The red spectral energy distribution (even in regions not affected by the Lyman $\alpha$ break) provides secure evidence of a large dust column. However, the inferred extinction curve shows a prominent flat component between 2000 and 3000 {\AA} in the rest frame, inconsistent with any locally observed template but well fitted by models of dust formed by supernovae. Time-dependent fits to the extinction profile reveal no evidence of dust destruction and limit the decrease in the extinction column to A3000 < 0.54 mag after t = 50 s in the rest frame. Together with studies of high-z quasars, our observations suggest a transition in dust properties in the early Universe, possibly associated with a transition between supernova-dominated and asymptotic giant branch-dominated modes of dust production.},

abstract = {The purported spiral host galaxy of GRB 020819B at z=0.41 has been seminal in establishing our view of the diversity of long-duration gamma-ray burst environments: optical spectroscopy of this host provided evidence that GRBs can form even at high metallicities, while millimetric observations suggested that GRBs may preferentially form in regions with minimal molecular gas. We report new observations from VLT (MUSE and X-shooter) which demonstrate that the purported host is an unrelated foreground galaxy. The probable radio afterglow is coincident with a compact, highly star-forming, dusty galaxy at z=1.9621. The revised redshift naturally explains the apparent nondetection of CO(3-2) line emission at the afterglow site from ALMA. There is no evidence that molecular gas properties in GRB host galaxies are unusual, and limited evidence that GRBs can form readily at super-Solar metallicity.},

abstract = {Wide-field optical surveys have begun to uncover large samples of fast (trise ≲ 5 d), luminous (Mpeak < -18), blue transients. While commonly attributed to the breakout of a supernova shock into a dense wind, the great distances to the transients of this class found so far have hampered detailed investigation of their properties. We present photometry and spectroscopy from a comprehensive worldwide campaign to observe AT 2018cow (ATLAS 18qqn), the first fast-luminous optical transient to be found in real time at lowredshift. Our first spectra (<2 days after discovery) are entirely featureless. A very broad absorption feature suggestive of nearrelativistic velocities develops between 3 and 8 days, then disappears. Broad emission features of H and He develop after >10 days. The spectrum remains extremely hot throughout its evolution, and the photospheric radius contracts with time (receding below R < 1014 cm after 1 month). This behaviour does not match that of any known supernova, although a relativistic jet within a fallback supernova could explain some of the observed features. Alternatively, the transient could originate from the disruption of a star by an intermediate-mass black hole, although thiswould require long-lasting emission of highly super-Eddington thermal radiation. In either case, AT 2018cow suggests that the population of fast luminous transients represents a new class of astrophysical event. Intensive follow-up of this event in its late phases, and of any future events found at comparable distance, will be essential to better constrain their origins.},

abstract = {The amount and properties of high-redshift galactic and intergalactic (IG) dust are largely unknown but could be investigated using multiwavelength photometry of high-z objects that have a known intrinsic spectrum. Observations of $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) afterglows appear to support the theoretical model of an adiabatic blast wave expanding into an external medium. In this model the synchrotron peak flux is independent of frequency, providing a flat spectrum when observed over time, and therefore allowing straightforward measurement of the relative attenuation of afterglow flux in widely separated bands. Applying this method to dust extinction, we show that for a sample of afterglows that have been corrected by galactic extinction comparison between the number counts of peak fluxes in X-ray versus optical can provide constraints on an intergalactic component of dust. A similar technique can probe the redshift dependence of extinction in GRB-forming regions without requiring an assumed relation between extinction and reddening by the dust. Probing systematic changes in extinction with redshift, particularly in IG and/or nonreddening dust, is crucial to a proper interpretation of the Type Ia supernova Hubble diagram and similar observations and useful for understanding GRB progenitor environments.},

abstract = {The metallicity in portions of high-redshift galaxies has been successfully measured thanks to the gas observed in absorption in the spectra of quasars, in the Damped Lyman-alpha systems (DLAs). Surprisingly, the global mean metallicity derived from DLAs is about 1/10th solar at 0<z<4 leading to the so-called ``missing-metals problem''. In this paper, we present high-resolution observations of a sub-DLA system at z_abs=0.716 with super-solar metallicity toward SDSS J1323-0021. This is the highest metallicity intervening quasar absorber currently known, and is only the second super-solar absorber known to date. We provide a detailed study of this unique object from VLT/UVES spectroscopy. We derive [Zn/H]=+0.61, [Fe/H]=-0.51, [Cr/H]=<-0.53, [Mn/H] = -0.37, and [Ti/H] = -0.61. Observations and photoionisation models using the CLOUDY software confirm that the gas in this sub-DLA is predominantly neutral and that the abundance pattern is probably significantly different from a Solar pattern. Fe/Zn and Ti/Zn vary among the main velocity components by factors of \$\sim$ 3 and $\sim$ 35, respectively, indicating non-uniform dust depletion. Mn/Fe is super-solar in almost all components, and varies by a factor of $\sim$ 3 among the dominant components. It would be interesting to observe more sub-DLA systems and determine whether they might contribute significantly toward the cosmic budget of metals.},

abstract = {An accurate method to measure the abundance of high-redshift galaxies consists in the observation of absorbers along the line of sight toward a background quasar. Here, we present abundance measurements of 13 z>3 sub-Damped Lyman-alpha Systems (quasar absorbers with HI column density 19 < log N(HI) < 20.3 cm^-2) based on the high resolution observations with VLT UVES spectrograph. These observations more than double the metallicity information for sub-DLAs previously available at z>3. This new data, combined with other sub-DLA measurements from the literature, confirm the stronger metallicity redshift evolution than for the classical Damped Lyman-alpha absorbers. Besides, these observations are used to compute for the first time the fraction of gas ionised from photo-ionisation modelling in a sample of sub-DLAs. Based on these results, we calculate that sub-DLAs contribute no more than 6% of the expected amount of metals at z$\sim$2.5. We therefore conclude that even if sub-DLAs are found to be more metal-rich than classical DLAs, they are insufficient to close the so-called ``missing metals problem''.},

abstract = {The light from distant supernovae (SNe) can be magnified through gravitational lensing when a foreground galaxy is located along the line of sight. This line-up allows for detailed studies of SNe at high redshift that otherwise would not be possible. Spectroscopic observations of lensed high-redshift Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are of particular interest since they can be used to test for evolution of their intrinsic properties. The use of SNe Ia for probing the cosmic expansion history has proven to be an extremely powerful method for measuring cosmological parameters. However, if systematic redshift-dependent properties are found, their usefulness for future surveys could be challenged. We investigate whether the spectroscopic properties of the strongly lensed and very distant SN Ia PS1-10afx at $z=1.4$ deviates from the well-studied populations of normal SNe Ia at nearby or intermediate distance. We created median spectra from nearby and intermediate-redshift spectroscopically normal SNe Ia from the literature at -5 and +1 days from light-curve maximum. We then compared these median spectra to those of PS1-10afx. We do not find signs of spectral evolution in PS1-10afx. The observed deviation between PS1-10afx and the median templates are within what is found for SNe at low- and intermediate-redshift. There is a noticeable broad feature centred at $\rm \lambda\sim 3500$$\sim$\AA{}, which is present only to a lesser extent in individual low and intermediate redshift SN Ia spectra. From a comparison with a recently developed explosion model, we find this feature to be dominated by iron peak elements, in particular, singly ionized cobalt and chromium.},

abstract = {We present the results of a detailed study of the interstellar medium (ISM) of MS 1512{\`{A}}cB58 (cB58 for short), an $L* Lyman break galaxy at z = 2.7276, based on new spectral observations obtained with the Echelle Spectrograph and Imager on the Keck II telescope at 58 km s {\`{A}}1 resolution. We focus in particular on the chemical abundances and kinematics of the interstellar gas deduced from the analysis of 48 ultraviolet absorption lines, at rest wavelengths between 1134 and 2576 {\AA} , due to elements from H to Zn. Our main find-ings are as follows. Even at this relatively early epoch, the ISM of this galaxy is already highly enriched in ele-ments released by Type II supernovae; the abundances of O, Mg, Si, P, and S are all $2/5 of their solar values. In contrast, N and the Fe-peak elements Mn, Fe, and Ni are underabundant by a factor of $3. Based on current ideas of stellar nucleosynthesis, these results can be understood if most of the metal enrichment in cB58 has taken place within the last $300 Myr, the timescale for the release of N from intermediate-mass stars. Such a young age is consistent with the UV-optical spectral energy distribution. Thus, cB58 seems to be an example of a galaxy in the process of converting its gas into stars on a few dynamical timescales—quite possibly we are witnessing the formation of a galactic bulge or an elliptical galaxy. The energetic star forma-tion activity has stirred the interstellar medium to high velocities; the strongest absorption lines span a veloc-ity interval of $1000 km s {\`{A}}1 . The net effect is a bulk outflow of the ISM at a speed of $255 km s {\`{A}}1 and at a rate that exceeds the star formation rate. It is unclear whether this gas will be lost or retained by the galaxy. On the one hand, the outflow probably has sufficient energy to escape the potential well of cB58, for which we derive a baryonic mass of $10 10 M . On the other hand, at least some of the elements manufactured by pre-vious generations of stars must have mixed efficiently with the ambient, neutral, ISM to give the high abun-dances we measure. We point out that the chemical and kinematic properties of cB58 are markedly different from those of most damped Ly systems at the same redshift.},

abstract = {We report new observations of ZnII and CrII absorption lines in 10 damped \lya systems (DLAs), mostly at redshift $z_{abs} \simgt 2.5$ . By combining these results with those from our earlier survey (Pettini et al. 1994) and other recent data, we construct a sample of 34 measurements (or upper limits) of the Zn abundance relative to hydrogen [Zn/H]; the sample includes more than one third of the total number of DLAs known. The plot of the abundance of Zn as a function of redshift reinforces the two main findings of our previous study. (1) Damped \lya systems are mostly metal-poor, at all redshifts sampled; the column density weighted mean for the whole data set is [Zn/H] $= -1.13 \pm 0.38$ (on a logarithmic scale), or approximately 1/13 of solar. (2) There is a large spread, by up to two orders of magnitude, in the metallicities we measure at essentially the same redshifts. We propose that damped \lya systems are drawn from a varied population of galaxies of different morphological types and at different stages of chemical evolution, supporting the idea of a protracted epoch of galaxy formation. At redshifts $z \simgt 2$ the typical metallicity of the damped \lya systems is in agreement with expectations based on the consumption of HI gas implied by the recent measurements of $\Omega_{DLA}$ by Storrie-Lombardi et al. (1996a), and with the metal ejection rates in the universe at these epochs deduced by Madau (1996) from the ultraviolet luminosities of high redshift galaxies revealed by deep imaging surveys. There are indications in our data for an increase in the mean metallicity of the damped \lya systems from $z > 3$ to $\approx 2$, consistent with the rise in the comoving star formation rate indicated by the relative numbers of $U$ and $B$ drop-outs in the Hubble Deep Field. Although such comparisons are still tentative, it appears that these different avenues for exploring the early evolution of galaxies give a broadly consistent picture.},

We select forest absorbers by their flux in bins 138 km/s wide (approximately the size of the BOSS resolution element). We split these absorbers into five samples spanning the range of flux -0.05 < F<0.45. Tests on a smaller sample of high-resolution spectra show that our three strongest absorption bins would probe circumgalactic regions (projected separation < 300 proper kpc and |Delta v| < 300km/s) in about 60% of cases for very high signal-to-noise ratio. Within this subset, weakening Lya absorption is associated with decreasing purity of circumgalactic selection once BOSS noise is included. Our weaker two Lya absorption samples are dominated by the intergalactic medium. We present composite spectra of these samples and a catalogue of measured absorption features from HI and 13 metal ionization species, all of which we make available to the community. We compare measurements of seven Lyman series transitions in our composite spectra to single line models and obtain further constraints from their associated excess Lyman limit opacity. This analysis provides results consistent with column densities over the range 14.4 <$\sim$ Log (N_HI) <$\sim$ 16.45. We compare our measurements of metal absorption to a variety of simple single-line, single-phase models for a preliminary interpretation. Our results imply clumping on scales down to $\sim$30 pc and near-solar metallicities in the circumgalactic samples, while high-ionization metal absorption consistent with typical IGM densities and metallicities is visible in all samples.},

abstract = {The XMM Large Scale Structure survey (XMM-LSS) is a medium deep large area X-ray survey. Its goal is to extend large scale structure investigations attempted using ROSAT cluster samples to two redshift bins between 0 < z < 1 while maintaining the precision of earlier studies. Two main goals have constrained the survey design: the evolutionary study of the cluster-cluster correlation function and of the cluster number density. The adopted observing configuration consists of an equatorial mosaic of 10 ks pointings, separated by 20′ and covering 8° × 8°, giving a pointsource sensitivity of ∼5 × 10-15 erg cm-2 s-1 in the 0.5-2 keV band. This will yield more than 800 clusters of galaxies and a sample of X-ray AGN with a space density of about 300 deg-2. We present the expected cosmological implications of the survey in the context of ACDM models and cluster evolution. We give an overview of the first observational results. The XMM-LSS survey is associated with several other major surveys, ranging from the UV to the radio wavebands, which will provide the necessary resources for X-ray source identification and further statistical studies. In particular, the associated CFHTLS weak lensing and AMiBA Sunyaev-Zel'dovich surveys over the entire XMM-LSS area will provide for the first time a comprehensive study of the mass distribution and of cluster physics in the universe on scales of a, few hundred Mpc. We describe the main characteristics of our wavelet-based X-ray pipeline and source identification procedures, including the classification of the cluster candidates by means of a photometric redshift analysis. This permits the selection of suitable targets for spectroscopic follow-up. We present preliminary results from the first 25 XMM-LSS pointings: X-ray source properties, optical counterparts, and highlights from the first Magellan and VLT/FORS2 spectroscopic runs as well as preliminary results from the NIR search for z > 1 clusters. The results are promising and, so far, in accordance with our predictions. In particular: (1) we reproduce the log N-log S distribution for point sources obtained from deeper surveys at our sensitivity; (2) we find a cluster number density of 15-20 deg-2; (3) for the first time, we statistically sample the group mass regime at a redshift out to ∼0.5. {\textcopyright}2004 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most powerful explosions since the\nformation of the Universe, associated with the death of massive stars or\nmergers of compact stellar objects. Several recent striking results\nstrongly support the idea that host galaxies of GRBs are opening a new\nview on our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, back to the\nvery primordial universe at z similar to 8. They form a unique sample of\ngalaxies which cover a wide range of redshift, they are typically weak\nwith low mass and unlike other methods they are not selected on\nluminosity. In recent years, thanks to the support of new generation\ninstruments, multi-band photometry and spectroscopy allow us to better\ninvestigate the properties of these host galaxies (e. g., stellar mass,\nage, SFR, metallicity), to study their possible evolution and to compare\nthem with field galaxies and other classes of galaxies. GRB host\nspectroscopy is one of the main science drivers behind the X-shooter\nspectrograph. In this paper, we present the first results of the program\ndevoted to Italian-French GTO multiband spectroscopy of GRB host\ngalaxies with X-shooter. (C) 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH&Co.

abstract = {Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond bursts of radio radiation whose progenitors so far remain mysterious. Nevertheless, the timescales and energetics of the events have lead to many theories associating FRBs with young neutron stars. Motivated by this, I explore the interaction of FRBs with young supernova remnants (SNRs), and I discuss the potential observational consequences and constraints of such a scenario. As the SN ejecta plows into the interstellar medium (ISM), a reverse shock is generated that passes back through the material and ionizes it. This leads to a dispersion measure (DM) associated with the SNR as well as a time derivative for DM. Times when DM is high are generally overshadowed by free-free absorption, which, depending on the mass of the ejecta and the density of the ISM, may be probed at frequencies of $400\,{\rm MHz}$ to $1.4\,{\rm GHz}$ on timescales of $\sim100-500\,{\rm yrs}$ after the SN. Magnetic fields generated at the reverse shock may be high enough to explain Faraday rotation that has been measured for one FRB. If FRBs are powered by the spin energy of a young NS (rather than magnetic energy), the NS must have a magnetic field $\lesssim10^{11}-10^{12}\,{\rm G}$ to ensure that it does not spin down too quickly while the SNR is still optically thick at radio frequencies. In the future, once there are distance measurements to FRBs and their energetics are better understood, the spin of the NS can also be constrained.},

Potential applications are the tidal disruption of stars by black holes, engine-powered supernovae, and unique fast transients found by current and future wide-field surveys. We derive relations between the injected and observed luminosity for steady and time dependent winds, and discuss how the temperature is set for scattering-dominated radiative transport. We apply this framework to specific examples of tidal disruption events and the formation of a black hole by a massive star, as well as discuss other applications such as deriving observables from detailed hydrodynamic simulations. We conclude by exploring what is inferred about the mass loss rate and underlying engine powering AT2018cow if it is explained as a wind-reprocessed transient, demonstrating that its optical emission is consistent with reprocessing of the observed soft X-rays.},

abstract = {We present the first results based on Planck measurements of the CMB temperature and lensing-potential power spectra. The Planck spectra at high multipoles are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flat six-parameter LCDM cosmology. In this model Planck data determine the cosmological parameters to high precision. We find a low value of the Hubble constant, H0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/Mpc and a high value of the matter density parameter, Omega_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreement with constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including curvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to percent-level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We present results from an analysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data sets in addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are favoured significantly over standard LCDM. The deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes in the matter content of the Universe. We find a 95% upper limit of r<0.11 on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like relativistic particles. Using BAO and CMB data, we find N_eff=3.30+/-0.27 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of 0.23 eV for the summed neutrino mass. Our results are in excellent agreement with big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of N_eff=3.046. We find no evidence for dynamical dark energy. Despite the success of the standard LCDM model, this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the CMB power spectrum at low multipoles, as noted previously by the WMAP team. While not of decisive significance, this is an anomaly in an otherwise self-consistent analysis of the Planck temperature data.},

abstract = {If damped Lyman alpha systems (DLAs) contain even modest amounts of dust, the ultraviolet luminosity of the background quasar can be severely diminished. When the spectrum is redshifted, this leads to a bias in optical surveys for DLAs. Previous estimates of the magnitude of this effect are in some tension; in particular, the distribution of DLAs in the (NHI, Z) (i.e. column density-metallicity) plane has led to claims that we may be missing a considerable fraction of metal-rich, high column density DLAs, whereas radio surveys do not unveil a substantial population of otherwise hidden systems. Motivated by this tension, we perform a Bayesian parameter estimation analysis of a simple dust obscuration model. We include radio and optical observations of DLAs in our overall likelihood analysis and show that these do not, in fact, constitute conflicting constraints. Our model gives statistical limits on the biasing effects of dust, predicting that only 7 per cent of DLAs are missing from optical samples due to dust obscuration; at 2$\sigma$ confidence, this figure takes a maximum value of 17 per cent. This contrasts with recent claims that DLA incidence rates are underestimated by 30-50 per cent. Optical measures of the mean metallicities of DLAs are found to underestimate the true value by just 0.1dex (or at most 0.4dex,2$\sigma$ confidence limit), in agreement with the radio survey results of Akerman et al. As an independent test, we use our model to make a rough prediction for dust reddening of the background quasar. We find a mean reddening in the DLA rest frame of log10 <E(B - V)> $\sim$= -2.4 +/- 0.6, consistent with direct analysis of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar population by Vladilo et al., log10 <E(B - V)> = -2.2 +/- 0.1. The quantity most affected by dust biasing is the total cosmic density of metals in DLAs, $\Omega$Z,DLA, which is underestimated in optical surveys by a factor of approximately 2.},

abstract = {Improvement in the precision of measurements of cosmological parameters with Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) is expected to come from large photometrically identified (photometric) SN samples. Here we re-analyse the SDSS photometric SN sample, with roughly 700 high-quality, likely but unconfirmed SNIa light-curves, to develop new analysis tools aimed at evaluating systematic uncertainties on the dark energy equation-of-state parameter $w$. Since we require a spectroscopically measured host galaxy redshift for each SN, we determine the associated selection efficiency of host galaxies in order to simulate bias corrections. We determine that the mis-association rate of host galaxies is $0.5\%$; ignoring this effect in simulated bias corrections leads to a $w$-bias of $\Delta w = -0.0005$, where $w$ is evaluated from SNIa and priors from measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations and the cosmic microwave background. We assess the uncertainty in our modeling of the host galaxy selection efficiency and find the associated $w$ uncertainty to be $0.0017$. Finally, we explore new core collapse (CC) models in simulated training samples and find that adjusting the CC luminosity distribution to be in agreement with previous Pan-STARRS analyses yields a better match to the SDSS data. The impact of ignoring this adjustment is $\Delta w = 0.0045$; the impact of replacing the new CC models with those used by Pan-STARRS is $\Delta w = -0.005$. These systematic uncertainties are subdominant to the statistical constraints from the SDSS sample, but must be considered in future photometric analyses of large SN samples such as those from DES, LSST and WFIRST.},

abstract = {We study the dust content of galaxies from $z=0$ to $z=9$ in semi-analytic models of galaxy formation that include new recipes to track the production and destruction of dust. We include condensation of dust in stellar ejecta, the growth of dust in the interstellar medium (ISM), the destruction of dust by supernovae and in the hot halo, and dusty winds and inflows. The rate of dust growth in the ISM depends on the metallicity and density of molecular clouds. Our fiducial model reproduces the relation between dust mass and stellar mass from $z=0$ to $z=7$, the number density of galaxies with dust masses less than $10^{8.3}\,\rm{M}_\odot$, and the cosmic density of dust at $z=0$. The model accounts for the double power-law trend between dust-to-gas (DTG) ratio and gas-phase metallicity of local galaxies and the relation between DTG ratio and stellar mass. The dominant mode of dust formation is dust growth in the ISM, except for galaxies with $M_*<10^7\,\rm{M}_\odot$, where condensation of dust in supernova ejecta dominates. The dust-to-metal ratio of galaxies depends on the gas-phase metallicity, unlike what is typically assumed in cosmological simulations. Model variants including higher condensation efficiencies, a fixed timescale for dust growth in the ISM, or no growth at all reproduce some of the observed constraints, but fail to simultaneously reproduce the shape of dust scaling relations and the dust mass of high-redshift galaxies.},

abstract = {We present a measurement of the volumetric rate of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) at z$\sim$1, measured using archival data from the first four years of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS). We develop a method for the photometric classification of SLSNe to construct our sample. Our sample includes two previously spectroscopically-identified objects, and a further new candidate selected using our classification technique. We use the point-source recovery efficiencies from Perrett et.al. (2010) and a Monte Carlo approach to calculate the rate based on our SLSN sample. We find that the three identified SLSNe from SNLS give a rate of 91 (+76/-36) SNe/Yr/Gpc^3 at a volume-weighted redshift of z=1.13. This is equivalent to 2.2 (+1.8/-0.9) x10^-4 of the volumetric core collapse supernova rate at the same redshift. When combined with other rate measurements from the literature, we show that the rate of SLSNe increases with redshift in a manner consistent with that of the cosmic star formation history. We also estimate the rate of ultra-long gamma ray bursts (ULGRBs) based on the events discovered by the Swift satellite, and show that it is comparable to the rate of SLSNe, providing further evidence of a possible connection between these two classes of events. We also examine the host galaxies of the SLSNe discovered in SNLS, and find them to be consistent with the stellar-mass distribution of other published samples of SLSNe.},

abstract = {We investigate the association between galaxies and metal-line and metal-free absorbers in the local universe (z < 0.16) using a large compilation of FUV spectra of bright AGN targets observed with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. In this homogeneous sample of 24 O VI detections (Z ≥ 0.1 Z) and 25 non-detections, the maximum distance O VI extends from galaxies of various luminosities is ∼ 0.6 Mpc, or ∼ 5 R vir , confirming and refining earlier results. This is an important value that must be matched by numerical simulations, which input the strength of galactic winds at the sub-grid level. We present evidence that the primary contributors to the spread of metals into the circum-and intergalactic media are L < L * galaxies. The maximum distances that metals are transported from these galaxies is comparable to the size of a small, spiral-rich group of galaxies. This suggests that, while rather pristine intergalactic material may accrete onto these groups where it can mix with metal-bearing clouds, the metals produced by the group galaxies may not leave the group, creating a nearly " closed box " for galactic evolution.},

abstract = {We have studied X-ray halos around 25 point sources and four supernova remnants using ROSAT observations. All sources were observed during the ROSAT all-sky survey, 8 point-like sources and 2 supernovae remnants have been studied additionally using ROSAT pointed observations. The shapes of the X-ray halos were fitted with commonly used dust models (e.g., the Mathis-Rumpl-Nordsiek grain size distribution), resulting in a determination of the fractional halo intensity, which in turn can be converted into a dust column density. From the simultaneously obtained X-ray spectra, the cold gas absorption and hence an equivalent hydrogen column was determined. A surprisingly good correlation exists between the simultaneously measured dust and hydrogen column densities,\nindicating that gas and dust must be to a large extent cospatial. For the X-ray sources with known optical counterparts, the visual extinction correlates well with the X-ray derived dust scattering optical depth tau_sca_: tau_sca_=0.087xA_v_(mag)xE(keV)^-2^ and\nN_H_[cm^-2^/A_v_]=1.79x10^21^. The strong correlation between both quantities indicates that, with only few exceptions, intrinsic\nabsorption by the X-ray source itself does not affect the derived absorption column densities. This method offers also the interesting possibility of verifying the optical identification of an X-ray source by using an X-ray property itself. In particular we find that for Cas A the optical extinction and the derived X-ray scattering are on the regression line but are too low for the observed absorption. Since Cas A's supernova was not observed optically, this supernova event must have been obscured by a local dust cloud. Finally, we have found a high degree of azimuthal symmetry in all the dust scattering halos of our sample, indicating, that the majority of dust grains responsible for the halo formation cannot be highly clumped in clouds.},

abstract = {We present the ATLAS discovery and initial analysis of the first 18 days of the unusual transient event, ATLAS18qqn/AT2018cow. It is characterized by a high peak luminosity ($\sim$1.7 $\times$ 10$^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$), rapidly evolving light curves ($>$5 mag rise to peak in $\sim$3.5 days), and hot blackbody spectra, peaking at $\sim$27000 K that are relatively featureless and unchanging over the first two weeks. The bolometric light curve cannot be powered by radioactive decay under realistic assumptions. The detection of high-energy emission may suggest a central engine as the powering source. Using a magnetar model, we estimated an ejected mass of $0.1-0.4$ \msol, which lies between that of low-energy core-collapse events and the kilonova, AT2017gfo. The spectra cooled rapidly from 27000 to 15000 K in just over 2 weeks but remained smooth and featureless. Broad and shallow emission lines appear after about 20 days, and we tentatively identify them as He I although they would be redshifted from their rest wavelengths. We rule out that there are any features in the spectra due to intermediate mass elements up to and including the Fe-group. The presence of r-process elements cannot be ruled out. If these lines are due to He, then we suggest a low-mass star with residual He as a potential progenitor. Alternatively, models of magnetars formed in neutron-star mergers give plausible matches to the data.},

abstract = {We report on strong H2 and CO absorption from gas within the host galaxy of gamma-ray burst (GRB) 080607. Analysis of our Keck/LRIS afterglow spectrum reveals a very large HI column density (NHI = 10^22.70 cm^-2) and strong metal-line absorption at z_GRB = 3.0363 with a roughly solar metallicity. We detect a series of A-X bandheads from CO and estimate N(CO) = 10^16.5 cm^-2 and T_ex^CO > 100K. We argue that the high excitation temperature results from UV pumping of the CO gas by the GRB afterglow. Similarly, we observe H2 absorption via the Lyman-Werner bands and estimate N(H2) = 10^21.2 cm^-2 with T_ex^H2 = 10--300K. The afterglow photometry suggests an extinction law with R_V=4 and A_V=3.2 mag and requires the presence of a modest 2175A bump. Additionally, modeling of the Swift/XRT X-ray spectrum confirms a large column density with N(H) = 10^22.58 cm^-2. Remarkably, this molecular gas has extinction properties, metallicity, and a CO/H2 ratio comparable to those of translucent molecular clouds of the Milky Way, suggesting that star formation at high z proceeds in similar environments as today. However, the integrated dust-to-metals ratio is sub-Galactic, suggesting the dust is primarily associated with the molecular phase while the atomic gas has a much lower dust-to-gas ratio. Sightlines like GRB 080607 serve as powerful probes of nucleosynthesis and star-forming regions in the young universe and contribute to the population of "dark" GRB afterglows.},

abstract = {The hosts of luminous z$\sim$2 quasars evolve into today's massive elliptical galaxies. Current theories predict that the circum-galactic medium (CGM) of these massive, dark-matter halos (M$\sim$10^12.5 Msun) should be dominated by a T$\sim$10^7 K virialized plasma. We test this hypothesis with observations of 74 close-projected quasar pairs, using spectra of the background QSO to characterize the CGM of the foreground one. Surprisingly, our measurements reveal a cool (T$\sim$10^4 K), massive (M_CGM > 10^10 Msun), and metal-enriched (Z > $\sim$0.1 Zsun) medium extending to at least the expected virial radius (r_vir = 160 kpc). The average equivalent widths of HI Lya (<W_lya> = 2.1 pm 0.15Ang for impact parameters R<200 kpc) and CII 1334 (<W_1334> = 0.7 pm 0.1Ang) exceed the corresponding CGM measurements of these transitions from all galaxy populations studied previously. Furthermore, we conservatively estimate that the quasar CGM has a 64% covering fraction of optically thick gas (N_HI>10^17.2) within r_vir; this covering factor is twice that of the contemporaneous Lyman Break Galaxy population. This unexpected reservoir of cool gas is rarely detected "down-the-barrel" to quasars, and hence it is likely that our background sightlines intercept gas which is shadowed from the quasar ionizing radiation by the same obscuring medium often invoked in models of AGN unification. Because the high-z halos inhabited by quasars predate modern groups and clusters, these observations are also relevant to the formation and enrichment history of the intragroup/intracluster medium.},

abstract = {We analyze new far-ultraviolet spectra of 13 quasars from the z$\sim$0.2 COS-Halos survey that cover the HI Lyman limit of 14 circumgalactic medium (CGM) systems. These data yield precise estimates or more constraining limits than previous COS-Halos measurements on the HI column densities NHI. We then apply a Monte-Carlo Markov Chain approach on 32 systems from COS-Halos to estimate the metallicity of the cool (T$\sim$10^4K) CGM gas that gives rise to low-ionization state metal lines, under the assumption of photoionization equilibrium with the extragalactic UV background. The principle results are: (1) the CGM of field L* galaxies exhibits a declining HI surface density with impact parameter Rperp (at >99.5%$ confidence), (2) the transmission of ionizing radiation through CGM gas alone is 70+/-7%; (3) the metallicity distribution function of the cool CGM is unimodal with a median of 1/3 Z_Sun and a 95% interval from \sim1/50 Z_Sun to over 3x solar. The incidence of metal poor (<1/100 Z_Sun) gas is low, implying any such gas discovered along quasar sightlines is typically unrelated to L* galaxies; (4) we find an unexpected increase in gas metallicity with declining NHI (at >99.9% confidence) and, therefore, also with increasing Rperp. The high metallicity at large radii implies early enrichment; (5) A non-parametric estimate of the cool CGM gas mass is M_CGM_cool = 9.2 +/- 4.3 10^10 Msun, which together with new mass estimates for the hot CGM may resolve the galactic missing baryons problem. Future analyses of halo gas should focus on the underlying astrophysics governing the CGM, rather than processes that simply expel the medium from the halo.},

abstract = {We investigate the ionization state of the damped Ly$\alpha$ system at z=2.62 toward GB 1759+7539 through an analysis of ionic ratios sensitive to photoionization: Ar0/S+, Fe++/Fe+, N+/N0, and Al++/Al+. Approximately half of the metals arise in a mostly neutral velocity component with H I/H>0.9, based on Fe++/Fe+<0.013. In contrast, the remaining half exhibit Fe++/Fe+$\sim$0.3, indicative of a partially ionized medium with H I/H$\sim$0.5. These conclusions are supported by the observed N+/N0, Al++/Al+, and Ar0/Si+ ratios. We assess ionization corrections for the observed column densities through photoionization models derived from the CLOUDY software package. In the neutral gas, the ionization corrections are negligible, except for Ar0. However, for the partially ionized gas, element abundance ratios differ from the ionic ratios by 0.1-0.3 dex for (Si+, S+, Ni+, Al+)/Fe+ ratios and more for (N0, Ar0)/Fe+. Independent of the shape of the photoionizing spectrum and assumptions of the number of ionization phases, these ionization corrections have minimal impact (<$\sim$0.1 dex) on the total metallicity inferred for this damped Ly$\alpha$ system. Measurements of the relative elemental abundances of the partially ionized gas, however, have a greater than $\sim$0.15 dex uncertainty, which hides the effects of nucleosynthesis and differential dust depletion. We caution the reader that this damped system is unusual for a number of reasons (e.g., a very low Ar0/S+ ratio), and we believe its ionization properties are special but not unique. Nevertheless, it clearly shows the value of examining photoionization diagnostics such as Fe++/Fe+ in a larger sample of damped systems.},

abstract = {We present a comprehensive analysis of the damped Lya (DLA) abundance database presented in the Ðrst paper of this series. This database provides a homogeneous set of abundance measurements for many elements including Si, Cr, Ni, Zn, Fe, Al, S, Co, O, and Ar from 38 DLA systems with z abs [ 1.5. With little exception, these DLA systems exhibit very similar relative abundances. There is no signiÐcant correlation in X/Fe with [Fe/H] metallicity, and the dispersion in X/Fe is small at all metallicity. We search the database for trends indicative of dust depletion and in a few cases Ðnd strong evidence. Spe-ciÐcally, we identify a correlation between [Si/Ti] and [Zn/Fe] which is unambiguous evidence for depletion. Following Hou and colleagues, we present [X/Si] abundances against [Si/H] ] log N(H I) and note trends of decreasing X/Si with increasing [Si/H] ] log N(H I) which argue for dust depletion. Similarly, comparisons of [Si/Fe] and [Si/Cr] against [Si/H] indicate signiÐcant depletion at [Si/ H] [ [1 but suggest essentially dust-free damped systems at [Si/H] \ [1.5 dex. We present a dis-cussion on the nucleosynthetic history of the DLA systems by focusing on abundance patterns which are minimally a ected by dust depletion. We Ðnd [Si/Fe] ] 0.25 dex as [Zn/Fe] ] 0 and that the [Si/Fe] values exhibit a plateau of B0.3 dex at [Si/H] \ [1.5 dex. Together these trends indicate signiÐcant a-enrichment in the DLA systems at low metallicity, an interpretation further supported by the observed O/Fe, S/Fe, and Ar/Fe ratios. Comparing the relative abundances of the Fe peak elements, we identify important o sets from solar relative abundances for Cr, Ni, and Fe which suggest variations in nucleo-synthesis along the Fe peak. Finally, the DLA systems exhibit a modest odd-even e ect revealed by Si/Al, [Si/Al] B 0.4 dex, which is signiÐcantly smaller than values observed in Galactic halo stars of comparable metallicity. These observations present strong evidence that the DLA systems and Galactic halo had di erent enrichment histories. To assess the impact of dust obscuration, we present estimates of the dust-to-gas ratios for the DLA sight lines and crudely calculate dust extinction corrections. The dis-tribution of extinction corrections suggests that the e ects of dust obscuration are minimal and that the population of " " missing {\"{I}}{\"{I}} damped systems has physical characteristics similar to the observed sample. We update our investigation on the chemical evolution of the early universe in neutral gas. The results are in good agreement with our previous work, but we emphasize two di erences : (1) the unweighted and N(H I){\`{E}}weighted [Fe/H] mean metallicities now have similar values at all epochs except z [ 3.5, where small number statistics dominate the N(H I){\`{E}}weighted mean ; and (2) there is no evolution in the mean [Fe/H] metallicity from z \ 1.7 to 3.5 but possibly a marked drop at higher redshift. We conclude with a general discussion on the physical nature of the DLA systems. We stress the uniformity of the DLA chemical abundances which indicates that the protogalaxies identiÐed with DLA systems have very similar enrichment histories, i.e., a nearly constant relative contribution from Type Ia and Type II super-novae. The DLA systems also show constant relative abundances within a given system, which places strict constraints on the mixing timescales of the damped systems and may pose a great challenge to the protogalactic clump scenarios favored by hierarchical galaxy formation.},

abstract = {We examine the practice of deriving interstellar medium (ISM) abundances from low-resolution spectroscopy of GRB afterglows. We argue that the multi-ion single-component curve-of-growth analysis technique systematically underestimates the column densities of the metal-line profiles commonly observed for GRB. This systematic underestimate is accentuated by the fact that many GRB line-profiles (e.g. GRB 050730, GRB 050820, GRB 051111) are comprised of `clouds' with a bi-modal distribution of column density. Such line-profiles may be characteristic of a sightline which penetrates both a high density star-forming region and more distant, ambient ISM material. Our analysis suggests that the majority of abundances reported in the literature are systematically underestimates and that the reported errors are frequently over-optimistic. Further, we demonstrate that one cannot even report precise relative abundances with confidence. The implications are profound for our current understanding on the metallicity, dust-to-gas ratio, and chemical abundances of the ISM in GRB host galaxies. For example, we argue that all but a few sightlines allow for the gas to have at least solar metallicity. Finally, we suggests new approaches for constraining the abundances.},

abstract = {We study the chemical abundances of the interstellar medium surrounding high-z gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) through analysis of the damped Ly$\alpha$ systems (DLAs) identified in afterglow spectra. These GRB DLAs are characterized by large H I column densities NH I and metallicities [M/H] spanning 1/100 to nearly solar, with median [M/H] > -1 dex. The majority of GRB DLAs have [M/H] values exceeding the cosmic mean metallicity of atomic gas at z > 2; i.e., if anything, the GRB DLAs are biased to larger metallicity. We also observe (1) large [Zn/Fe] values (>+0.6 dex) and subsolar Ti/Fe ratios, which imply substantial differential depletion; (2) large $\alpha$/Fe ratios, suggesting nucleosynthetic enrichment by massive stars; and (3) low C 0/C+ ratios (<10-4). Quantitatively, the observed depletion levels and C0/C+ ratios of the gas are not characteristic of cold, dense H I clouds in the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM). We argue that the GRB DLA represents the ISM near the GRB but not gas directly local to the GRB (e.g., its molecular cloud or circumstellar material). We compare these observations with DLAs intervening in background quasars (QSO DLAs). The GRB DLAs exhibit larger NH I values, higher $\alpha$/Fe and Zn/Fe ratios, and higher metallicity than the QSO DLAs. Although these differences are statistically significant, the offsets are relatively modest (NH I excepted). We argue that the differences result primarily from galactocentric radius-dependent differences in the ISM: GRB DLAs preferentially probe denser, more depleted, higher metallicity gas located in the inner few kiloparsecs, whereas QSO DLAs are more likely to intersect the less dense, less enriched, outer regions of the galaxy. Finally, we investigate whether dust obscuration may exclude GRB DLA sight lines from QSO DLA samples; we find that the majority of GRB DLAs would be recovered, which implies little observational bias against large NH I systems. {\textcopyright} 2007.

abstract = {Using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Data Release 5, we survey proximate damped Lya systems (PDLAs): absorption line systems with HI column density N(HI)> 2x10^20 cm^{-2} at velocity separation dv < 3000 km/s from their background quasar. These absorbers are physically associated with their background quasars, and their statistics allow us to study quasar environments out to z$\sim$5. However, the large ionizing flux emitted by a quasar can ionize the neutral gas in a nearby galaxy possibly giving rise to a ``proximity effect'', analogous to the similar effect observed in the Lya forest. From a sample of 111 PDLAs, we measure the HI frequency distribution f(N), incidence, and gas mass density of the PDLAs near luminous quasars over the redshift interval z= 2.2 to 5. The incidence and mass density of PDLAs at z$\sim$3 is approximately twice that of intervening DLAs, but at z<2.5 and z>3.5 the f(N) distribution is consistent with the intervening population. We interpret the observed enhancement of PDLAs around quasars in terms of quasar-galaxy clustering, and compare the strength of the clustering signal to the expectation from independent measures of the respective clustering strengths of DLAs and quasars, as well as a complementary analysis of the clustering of absorbers around quasars in the transverse direction. We find that there are a factor of 5-10 fewer PDLAs around quasars than expected and interpret this result as evidence for the hypothesis that the ionizing flux from the quasars photoevaporates HI in nearby DLA galaxies, thus reducing their cross-section for DLA absorption. This constitues the first detection of a ``proximity effect'' for DLAs.},

abstract = {We present chemical abundance measurements for 19 damped lya systems observed with HIRES on the 10m W.M. Keck Telescope. Our principal goal is to investigate the abundance patterns of the damped systems and thereby determine the underlying physical processes which dominate their chemical evolution. We place particular emphasis on gauging the relative importance of two complementary effects often invoked to explain the damped lya abundances: (1) nucleosynthetic enrichment from Type II supernovae and (2) an ISM-like dust depletion pattern. Similar to the principal results of Lu et al. (1996), our observations lend support both for dust depletion and Type II SN enrichment. Specifically, the observed overabundance of Zn/Fe and underabundance of Ni/Fe relative to solar abundances suggest significant dust depletion within the damped lya systems. Meanwhile, the relative abundances of Al, Si, and Cr vs. Fe are consistent with both dust depletion and Type II supernova enrichment. Our measurements of Ti/Fe and the Mn/Fe measurements from Lu et al. (1996), however, cannot be explained by dust depletion and indicate an underlying Type II SN pattern. Finally, the observed values of [S/Fe] are inconsistent with the combined effects of dust depletion and the nucleosynthetic yields expected for Type II supernovae. This last result emphasizes the need for another physical process to explain the damped lya abundance patterns. We also examine the metallicity of the damped lya systems both with respect to Zn/H and Fe/H. Our results confirm previous surveys by Pettini and collaborators, i.e., [<Zn/H>] = -1.15 +/- 0.15 dex.

abstract = {We present the results of a search for rapidly evolving transients in the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Programme. These events are characterized by fast light-curve evolution (rise to peak in≲10 d and exponential decline in≲30 d after peak).We discovered 72 events, including 37 transients with a spectroscopic redshift from host galaxy spectral features. The 37 events increase the total number of rapid optical transients by more than a factor of two. They are found at a wide range of redshifts (0.05 < z < 1.56) and peak brightnesses (-15.75 > Mg > -22.25). The multiband photometry is well fit by a blackbody up to few weeks after peak. The events appear to be hot (T ≈ 10 000-30 000 K) and large (R ≈ 1014 - 2 × 1015 cm) at peak, and generally expand and cool in time, though some events show evidence for a receding photosphere with roughly constant temperature. Spectra taken around peak are dominated by a blue featureless continuum consistent with hot, optically thick ejecta. We compare our events with a previously suggested physical scenario involving shock breakout in an optically thick wind surrounding a core-collapse supernova, we conclude that current models for such a scenario might need an additional power source to describe the exponential decline. We find that these transients tend to favour star-forming host galaxies, which could be consistent with a core-collapse origin. However, more detailed modelling of the light curves is necessary to determine their physical origin.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of DES17X1boj and DES16E2bjy, two peculiar transients discovered by the Dark Energy Survey (DES). They exhibit nearly identical double-peaked light curves that reach very different maximum luminosities (Mr = −15.4 and −17.9, respectively). The light-curve evolution of these events is highly atypical and has not been reported before. The transients are found in different host environments: DES17X1boj was found near the nucleus of a spiral galaxy, while DES16E2bjy is located in the outskirts of a passive red galaxy. Early photometric data are well fitted with a blackbody and the resulting moderate photospheric expansion velocities (1800 km s−1 for DES17X1boj and 4800 km s−1 for DES16E2bjy) suggest an explosive or eruptive origin. Additionally, a feature identified as high-velocity Ca ii absorption ($v$ ≈ 9400 km s−1) in the near-peak spectrum of DES17X1boj may imply that it is a supernova. While similar light-curve evolution suggests a similar physical origin for these two transients, we are not able to identify or characterize the progenitors.},

abstract = {Supernovae are stellar explosions driven by gravitational or thermonuclear energy that is observed as electromagnetic radiation emitted over weeks or more. In all known supernovae, this radiation comes from internal energy deposited in the outflowing ejecta by one or more of the following processes: radioactive decay of freshly synthesized elements2 (typically 56Ni), the explosion shock in the envelope of a supergiant star, and interaction between the debris and slowly moving, hydrogen-rich circumstellar material. Here we report observations of a class of luminous supernovae whose properties cannot be explained by any of these processes. The class includes four new supernovae that we have discovered and two previously unexplained events 5,6 (SN 2005ap and SCP 06F6) that we can now identify as members of the same class. These supernovae are all about ten times brighter than most type Ia supernova, do not show any trace of hydrogen, emit significant ultraviolet flux for extended periods of time and have late-time decay rates that are inconsistent with radioactivity. Our data require that the observed radiation be emitted by hydrogen-free material distributed over a large radius (∼10 15 centimetres) and expanding at high speeds (>10 4 kilometres per second). These long-lived, ultraviolet-luminous events can be observed out to redshifts z>4. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Circum-Galactic Medium (CGM) can be probed through the analysis of absorbing systems in the line-of-sight to bright background quasars. We present measurements of the metallicity of a new sample of 15 sub-damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers (sub-DLAs, defined as absorbers with 19.0 < log N(H I) < 20.3) with redshift 0.584 < $\rm z_{abs}$ < 3.104 from the ESO Ultra-Violet Echelle Spectrograph (UVES) Advanced Data Products Quasar Sample (EUADP). We combine these results with other measurements from the literature to produce a compilation of metallicity measurements for 92 sub-DLAs as well as a sample of 362 DLAs. We apply a multi-element analysis to quantify the amount of dust in these two classes of systems. We find that either the element depletion patterns in these systems differ from the Galactic depletion patterns or they have a different nucleosynthetic history than our own Galaxy. We propose a new method to derive the velocity width of absorption profiles, using the modeled Voigt profile features. The correlation between the velocity width delta_V90 of the absorption profile and the metallicity is found to be tighter for DLAs than for sub-DLAs. We report hints of a bimodal distribution in the [Fe/H] metallicity of low redshift (z < 1.25) sub-DLAs, which is unseen at higher redshifts. This feature can be interpreted as a signature from the metal-poor, accreting gas and the metal-rich, outflowing gas, both being traced by sub-DLAs at low redshifts.},

abstract = {We present a systematic temporal and spectral study of all Swift-XRT observations of GRB afterglows discovered between 2005 January and 2007 December. After constructing and fitting all light curves and spectra to power-law models, we classify the components of each afterglow in terms of the canonical X-ray afterglow and test them against the closure relations of the forward shock models for a variety of parameter combinations. The closure relations are used to identify potential jet breaks with characteristics including the uniform jet model with and without lateral spreading and energy injection, and a power-law structured jet model, all with a range of parameters. With this technique, we survey the X-ray afterglows with strong evidence for jet breaks ($\sim$12% of our sample), and reveal cases of potential jet breaks that do not appear plainly from the light curve alone (another $\sim$30%), leading to insight into the missing jet break problem. Those X-ray light curves that do not show breaks or have breaks that are not consistent with one of the jet models are explored to place limits on the times of unseen jet breaks. The distribution of jet break times ranges from a few hours to a few weeks with a median of $\sim$1 day, similar to what was found pre-Swift. On average Swift GRBs have lower isotropic equivalent gamma-ray energies, which in turn results in lower collimation corrected gamma-ray energies than those of pre-Swift GRBs. Finally, we explore the implications for GRB jet geometry and energetics.},

abstract = {We present evidence that the cosmological mean metallicity of neutral atomic hydrogen gas shows a sudden decrease at z>4.7 down to <Z>=-2.03(+0.09-0.11), which is 6 sigma deviant from that predicted by a linear fit to the data at lower redshifts. This measurement is made possible by the chemical abundance measurements of 8 new damped Ly-alpha (DLA) systems at z>4.7 observed with the Echellette Spectrograph and Imager on the Keck II telescope, doubling the number of measurements at z>4.7 to 16. Possible explanations for this sudden decrease in metallicity include a change in the physical processes that enrich the neutral gas within disks, or an increase of the covering factor of neutral gas outside disks due to a lower ultra-violet radiation field and higher density at high redshift. The later possibility would result in a new population of presumably lower metallicity DLAs, with an increased contribution to the DLA population at higher redshifts resulting in a reduced mean metallicity. Furthermore, we provide evidence of a possible decrease at z>4.7 in the comoving metal mass density of DLAs, which is flat out to z$\sim$4.3. Such a decrease is expected, as otherwise most of the metals from star-forming galaxies would reside in DLAs by z$\sim$6. While the metallicity is decreasing at high redshift, the contribution of DLAs to the total metal budget of the universe increases with redshift, with DLAs at z$\sim$4.3 accounting for $\sim$20% as many metals as produced by Lyman break galaxies.},

abstract = {We present chemical abundance measurements for 47 damped Lyman-alpha systems (DLAs), 30 at z>4, observed with the Echellette Spectrograph and Imager and the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer on the Keck telescopes. HI column densities of the DLAs are measured with Voigt profile fits to the Lyman-alpha profiles, and we find an increased number of false DLA identifications with SDSS at z>4 due to the increased density of the Lyman-alpha forest. Ionic column densities are determined using the apparent optical depth method, and we combine our new metallicity measurements with 195 from previous surveys to determine the evolution of the cosmic metallicity of neutral gas. We find the metallicity of DLAs decreases with increasing redshift, improving the significance of the trend and extending it to higher redshifts, with a linear fit of -0.22+-0.03 dex per unit redshift from z=0.09-5.06. The metallicity 'floor' of $\sim$1/600 solar continues out to z$\sim$5, despite our sensitivity for finding DLAs with much lower metallicities. However, this floor is not statistically different from a steep tail to the distribution. We also find that the intrinsic scatter of metallicity among DLAs of $\sim$0.5 dex continues out to z$\sim$5. In addition, the metallicity distribution and the alpha/Fe ratios of z>2 DLAs are consistent with being drawn from the same parent population with those of halo stars. It is therefore possible that the halo stars in the Milky Way formed out of gas that commonly exhibits DLA absorption at z>2.},

abstract = {We present the catalogue of the Mg II absorption systems detected at a high signif-icance level using an automated search algorithm in the spectra of quasars from the twelfth data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. A total of 266,433 background quasars were searched for the presence of absorption systems in their spectra. The continuum modelling for the quasar spectra was performed using a mean filter. A pseudo-continuum derived using a median filter was used to trace the emission lines. The absorption system catalogue contains 39,694 Mg II systems detected at a 6.0, 3.0$\sigma$ level respectively for the two lines of the doublet. The catalogue was constrained to an absorption line redshift of 0.35 z 2796 2.3. The rest-frame equivalent width of the $\lambda$2796 line ranges between 0.2 W r 6. A. Using Gaussian-noise only simulations we estimate a false positive rate of 7.7 per cent in the catalogue. We measured the number density ∂N 2796 /∂z of Mg II absorbers and find evidence for steeper evolu-tion of the systems with W r 1. A at low redshifts (z 2796 1.0), consistent with other earlier studies. A suite of null tests over the redshift range 0.5 z 2796 1.5 was used to study the presence of systematics and selection effects like the depen-dence of the number density evolution of the absorption systems on the properties of the background quasar spectra. The null tests do not indicate the presence of any selection effects in the absorption catalogue if the quasars with spectral signal-to-noise level less than 5.0 are removed. The resultant catalogue contains 36,981 absorption systems. The Mg II absorption catalogue is publicly available.},

PTF will also discover many new members of known source classes, from cataclysmic variables in their various avatars to supernovae and active galactic nuclei, and will provide important insights into understanding galactic dynamics (through RR Lyrae stars) and the Solar system (asteroids and near-Earth objects). The lessons that can be learned from PTF will be essential for the preparation of future large synoptic sky surveys like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.

abstract = {We present a comprehensive survey of C II * absorption detections toward stars within 100 pc in order to measure the distribution of electron densities present in the local interstellar medium (LISM). Using high spectral resolution observations of nearby stars obtained by the Goddard High-Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS) and the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we searched for all detections of LISM C II * absorption. We identify 13 sight lines with 23 individual C II * absorption components, which provide electron density measurements, the vast majority of which are new. We employ several strategies to determine more accurate C II column densities from the saturated C II resonance line, including, constraints of the line width from the optically thin C II * line, constraints from independent temperature measurements of the LISM gas based on line widths of other ions, and third, using measured S II column densities as a proxy for C II column densities. The distribution of electron densities based on using S II as a proxy for C II is similar to the distribution based on carbon alone, while significantly tighter, and proves to be a promising technique to avoid grossly overestimating the C II column density based on the saturated line profile. The sample of electron densities appears consistent with a log-normal distribution and an unweighted mean value of n e (C II SII) = 0.11 +0.10 −0.05 cm −3 . Seven individual sight lines probe the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC), and all present a similar value for the electron density, with a weighted mean of n e (LIC) = 0.12±0.04 cm −3 . Two clouds, the NGP and Gem clouds, show similar electron density properties as the LIC. The Hyades Cloud, a decelerated cloud at the leading edge of the platoon of LISM clouds, has a significantly higher electron density than the LIC. Observed toward G191-B2B, the high electron density may be caused by the lack of shielding from such a strong radiation source. 1 Hubble Fellow – 2 – No evidence of a correlation between electron density and angular separation of the sight line from the strongest extreme ultraviolet radiation source, ǫ CMa, is found. Given some simple assumptions, the range of observed electron densities translates into a range of thermal pressures, P/k = 3300 +5500 −1900 K cm −3 . This work greatly expands the number of electron density measurements and provides important constraints on the ionization, abundance, and evolutionary models of the local interstellar medium.},

abstract = {For decades, optical time-domain searches have been tuned to find ordinary supernovae, which rise and fall in brightness over a period of weeks. Recently, supernova searches have improved their cadences and a handful of fast-evolving luminous transients have been identified 1-5 . These have peak luminosities comparable to type Ia supernovae, but rise to maximum in less than ten days and fade from view in less than one month. Here we present the most extreme example of this class of object thus far: KSN 2015K, with a rise time of only 2.2 days and a time above half-maximum of only 6.8 days. We show that, unlike type Ia supernovae, the light curve of KSN 2015K was not powered by the decay of radioactive elements. We further argue that it is unlikely that it was powered by continuing energy deposition from a central remnant (a magnetar or black hole). Using numerical radiation hydrodynamical models, we show that the light curve of KSN 2015K is well fitted by a model where the supernova runs into external material presumably expelled in a pre-supernova mass-loss episode. The rapid rise of KSN 2015K therefore probes the venting of photons when a hypersonic shock wave breaks out of a dense extended medium.},

abstract = {We present griz light curves of 146 spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia Supernovae ($0.03 < z <0.65$) discovered during the first 1.5 years of the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey. The Pan-STARRS1 natural photometric system is determined by a combination of on-site measurements of the instrument response function and observations of spectrophotometric standard stars. We find that the systematic uncertainties in the photometric system are currently 1.2\% without accounting for the uncertainty in the HST Calspec definition of the AB system. A Hubble diagram is constructed with a subset of 113 out of 146 SNe Ia that pass our light curve quality cuts. The cosmological fit to 310 SNe Ia (113 PS1 SNe Ia + 222 light curves from 197 low-z SNe Ia), using only SNe and assuming a constant dark energy equation of state and flatness, yields $w=-1.120^{+0.360}_{-0.206}\textrm{(Stat)} ^{+0.269}_{-0.291}\textrm{(Sys)}$. When combined with BAO+CMB(Planck)+$H_0$, the analysis yields $\Omega_{\rm M}=0.280^{+0.013}_{-0.012}$ and $w=-1.166^{+0.072}_{-0.069}$ including all identified systematics (see also Scolnic et al. 2014). The value of $w$ is inconsistent with the cosmological constant value of $-1$ at the 2.3$\sigma$ level. Tension endures after removing either the BAO or the $H_0$ constraint, though it is strongest when including the $H_0$ constraint. If we include WMAP9 CMB constraints instead of those from Planck, we find $w=-1.124^{+0.083}_{-0.065}$, which diminishes the discord to $<2\sigma$. We cannot conclude whether the tension with flat $\Lambda$CDM is a feature of dark energy, new physics, or a combination of chance and systematic errors. The full Pan-STARRS1 supernova sample with $\sim\!\!$3 times as many SNe should provide more conclusive results.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society. The XMM Cluster Archive Super Survey (X-CLASS) is a serendipitously detected X-rayselected sample of 845 galaxy clusters based on 2774XMMarchival observations and covering an approximately 90 deg 2 spread across the high-Galactic latitude (|b|  >  20°) sky. The primary goal of this survey is to produce a well-selected sample of galaxy clusters on which cosmological analyses can be performed. This paper presents the photometric redshift followup of a high signal-to-noise ratio subset of 265 of these clusters with declination $\delta$  <  +20° with Gamma-Ray Burst Optical and Near-Infrared Detector (GROND), a 7-channel (grizJHK) simultaneous imager on the MPG 2.2-m telescope at the ESO La Silla Observatory. We use a newly developed technique based on the red sequence colour-redshift relation, enhanced with information coming from the X-ray detection to provide photometric redshifts for this sample. We determine photometric redshifts for 232 clusters, finding a median redshift of z = 0.39 with an accuracy of $\Delta$z = 0.02(1 + z) when compared to a sample of 76 spectroscopically confirmed clusters. We also computeX-ray luminosities for the entire sample and find amedian bolometric luminosity of 7.2 × 10 43 erg s -1 and a median temperature of 2.9 keV. We compare our results to those of the XMM-XCS and XMM-XXL surveys, finding good agreement in both samples.},

abstract = {The primordial deuterium abundance probes fundamental physics during the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and can be used to infer cosmological parameters. Observationally, the abundance can be measured using absorbing clouds along the lines of sight to distant quasars. Observations of the quasar PKS1937--101 contain two absorbers for which the deuterium abundance has previously been determined. Here we focus on the higher redshift one at $z_{abs} = 3.572$. We present new observations with significantly increased signal-to-noise ratio which enable a far more precise and robust measurement of the deuterium to hydrogen column density ratio, resulting in D/H = $2.62\pm0.05\times10^{-5}$. This particular measurement is of interest because it is among the most precise assessments to date and it has been derived from the second lowest column-density absorber [N(HI) $=17.9\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$] that has so-far been utilised for deuterium abundance measurements. The majority of existing high-precision measurements were obtained from considerably higher column density systems [i.e. N(HI) $>19.4\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$]. This bodes well for future observations as low column density systems are more common.},

abstract = {As part of an on-going effort to identify, understand and correct for astrophysics biases in the standardization of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) for cosmology, we have statistically classified a large sample of nearby SNeIa into those located in predominantly younger or older environments. This classification is based on the specific star formation rate measured within a projected distance of 1kpc from each SN location (LsSFR). This is an important refinement compared to using the local star formation rate directly as it provides a normalization for relative numbers of available SN progenitors and is more robust against extinction by dust. We find that the SNeIa in predominantly younger environments are DY=0.163\pm0.029 mag (5.7 sigma) fainter than those in predominantly older environments after conventional light-curve standardization. This is the strongest standardized SN Ia brightness systematic connected to host-galaxy environment measured to date. The well-established step in standardized brightnesses between SNeIa in hosts with lower or higher total stellar masses is smaller at DM=0.119\pm0.032 mag (4.5 sigma), for the same set of SNeIa. When fit simultaneously, the environment age offset remains very significant, with DY=0.129\pm0.032 mag (4.0 sigma), while the global stellar mass step is reduced to DM=0.064\pm0.029 mag (2.2 sigma). Thus, approximately 70% of the variance from the stellar mass step is due to an underlying dependence on environment-based progenitor age. Standardization using only the SNeIa in younger environments reduces the total dispersion from 0.142\pm0.008 mag to 0.120\pm0.010 mag. We show that as environment ages evolve with redshift a strong bias on measurement of the dark energy equation of state parameters can develop. Fortunately, data to measure and correct for this effect is likely to be available for many next-generation experiments. [abstract shorten]},

abstract = {Both observations and simulations show that major tidal interactions or mergers between gas-rich galaxies can lead to intense bursts of starformation. Yet, the average enhancement in star formation rate (SFR) in major mergers and the contribution of such events to the cosmic SFR are not well estimated. Here we use photometric redshifts, stellar masses and UV SFRs from COMBO-17, 24 micron SFRs from Spitzer and morphologies from two deep HST cosmological survey fields (ECDFS/GEMS and A901/STAGES) to study the enhancement in SFR as a function of projected galaxy separation. We apply two-point projected correlation function techniques, which we augment with morphologically-selected very close pairs (separation <2 arcsec) and merger remnants from the HST imaging. Our analysis confirms that the most intensely star-forming systems are indeed interacting or merging. Yet, for massive (M* > 10^10 Msun) star-forming galaxies at 0.4<z<0.8, we find that the SFRs of galaxies undergoing a major interaction (mass ratios <1:4 and separations < 40 kpc) are only 1.80 +/- 0.30 times higher than the SFRs of non-interacting galaxies when averaged over all interactions and all stages of the interaction, in good agreement with other observational works. We demonstrate that these results imply that <10% of star formation at 0.4 < z < 0.8 is triggered directly by major mergers and interactions; these events are not important factors in the build-up of stellar mass since z=1.},

abstract = {(Abridged) The contemporary discoveries of galaxies and gamma ray bursts (GRBs) at high redshift have supplied the first direct information on star formation when the universe was only a few hundred million years old. The probable origin of long duration GRBs in the deaths of massive stars would link the universal GRB rate to the redshift-dependent star formation rate density, although exactly how is currently unknown. As the most distant GRBs and star-forming galaxies probe the reionization epoch, the potential rewards of understanding the redshift-dependent ratio Psi(z) of the GRB rate to star formation rate are significant and include addressing fundamental questions such as incompleteness in rest-frame UV surveys for determining the star formation rate at high redshift and time variations in the stellar initial mass function. Using an extensive sample of 112 GRBs above a fixed luminosity limit drawn from the Second Swift Burst Alert Telescope catalog, we compare the cumulative redshift distribution N(< z) of GRBs with the star formation density rho_sfr(z) measured from UV-selected galaxies over 0 < z < 4. Strong evolution (e.g., Psi(z) \propto (1+z)^{1.5}) is disfavored, while more modest evolution (e.g., Psi(z) \propto (1+z)^{0.5}) is consistent with the data. If such trends continue beyond z $\sim$ 4, we find the discovery rate of distant GRBs implies a star formation rate density much higher than that inferred from UV-selected galaxies. We show that such a star formation history would over-predict the observed stellar mass density at z > 4 measured from rest-frame optical surveys. The resolution of this important disagreement is currently unclear, and the GRB production rate at early times is likely more complex than a simple function of star formation rate and progenitor metallicity.},

abstract = {We have constructed merger trees for galaxies in the Illustris Simulation by directly tracking the baryonic content of subhalos. These merger trees are used to calculate the galaxy-galaxy merger rate as a function of descendant stellar mass, progenitor stellar mass ratio, and redshift. We demonstrate that the most appropriate definition for the mass ratio of a galaxy-galaxy merger consists in taking both progenitor masses at the time when the secondary progenitor reaches its maximum stellar mass. Additionally, we avoid effects from `orphaned' galaxies by allowing some objects to `skip' a snapshot when finding a descendant, and by only considering mergers which show a well-defined `infall' moment. Adopting these definitions, we obtain well-converged predictions for the galaxy-galaxy merger rate with the following main features, which are qualitatively similar to the halo-halo merger rate except for the last one: a strong correlation with redshift that evolves as $\sim (1+z)^{2.4-2.8}$, a power law with respect to mass ratio, and an increasing dependence on descendant stellar mass, which steepens significantly for descendant stellar masses greater than $\sim 2 \times 10^{11} \, {\rm M_{\odot}}$. These trends are consistent with observational constraints for medium-sized galaxies ($M_{\ast} \gtrsim 10^{10} \, {\rm M_{\odot}}$), but in tension with some recent observations of the close pair fraction for massive galaxies ($M_{\ast} \gtrsim 10^{11} \, {\rm M_{\odot}}$), which report a nearly constant or decreasing evolution with redshift. Finally, we provide a fitting function for the galaxy-galaxy merger rate which is accurate over a wide range of stellar masses, progenitor mass ratios, and redshifts.},

abstract = {GRB051022 was undetected to deep limits in early optical observations, but precise astrometry from radio and X-ray showed that it most likely originated in a galaxy at z$\sim$0.8. We report radio, optical, near infra-red and X-ray observations of GRB051022. Using the available X-ray and radio data, we model the afterglow and calculate the energetics of the afterglow, finding it to be an order of magnitude lower than that of the prompt emission. The broad-band modeling also allows us to precisely define various other physical parameters and the minimum required amount of extinction, to explain the absence of an optical afterglow. Our observations suggest a high extinction, at least 2.3 magnitudes in the infrared (J) and at least 5.4 magnitudes in the optical (U) in the host-galaxy restframe. Such high extinctions are unusual for GRBs, and likely indicate a geometry where our line of sight to the burst passes through a dusty region in the host that is not directly co-located with the burst itself.},

abstract = {We present the first Swift Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow catalog. The catalog contains data from over 64,000 independent UVOT image observations of 229 GRBs first detected by Swift, the High Energy Transient Explorer 2 (HETE2), the International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL), and the Interplanetary Network (IPN). The catalog covers GRBs occurring during the period from 2005 January 17 to 2007 June 16 and includes ∼86% of the bursts detected by the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT). The catalog provides detailed burst positional, temporal, and photometric information extracted from each of the UVOT images. Positions for bursts detected at the 3$\sigma$ level are provided with a nominal accuracy, relative to the USNO-B1 catalog, of ∼ 0. 25. Photometry for each burst is given in three UV bands, three optical bands, and a " white " or open filter. Upper limits for magnitudes are reported for sources detected below 3$\sigma$ . General properties of the burst sample and light curves, including the filter-dependent temporal slopes, are also provided. The majority of the UVOT light curves, for bursts detected at the 3$\sigma$ level, can be fit by a single power-law, with a median temporal slope ($\alpha$) of 0.96, beginning several hundred seconds after the burst trigger and ending at ∼ 1 × 10 5 s. The median UVOT v-band (∼5500 {\AA}) magnitude at 2000 s for a sample of " well " -detected bursts is 18.02. The UVOT flux interpolated to 2000 s after the burst, shows relatively strong correlations with both the prompt Swift BAT fluence, and the Swift X-ray flux at 11 hr after the trigger.},

This is accomplished through the use ofUVand optical broadband filters and grisms.

abstract = {The reliability of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) may be limited by the imprint of their galactic origins. To investigate the connection between supernovae and their host characteristics, we developed an improved method to estimate the stellar population age of the host as well as the local environment around the site of the supernova. We use a Bayesian method to estimate the star formation history and mass weighted age of a supernova's environment by matching observed spectral energy distributions to a synthesized stellar population. Applying this age estimator to both the photometrically and spectroscopically classified Sloan Digital Sky Survey II supernovae (N=103) we find a $0.114 \pm 0.039\sim{\rm mag}$ `step' in the average Hubble residual at a stellar age of $\sim 8\sim\text{Gyr}$; it is nearly twice the size of the currently popular mass step. We then apply a principal component analysis on the SALT2 parameters, host stellar mass, and local environment age. We find that a new parameter, PC$_1$, consisting of a linear combination of stretch, host stellar mass, and local age, shows a very significant ($4.7\sigma$) correlation with Hubble residuals. There is a much broader range of PC$_1$ values found in the Hubble flow sample when compared with the Cepheid calibration galaxies. These samples have mildly statistically different average PC$_1$ values, at $\sim 2.5\sigma$, resulting in at most a 1.3% reduction in the evaluation of H$_0$. Despite accounting for the highly significant trend in SNIa Hubble residuals, there remains a 9% discrepancy between the most recent precision estimates of H$_0$ using SNIa and the CMB.},

abstract = {We report on the discovery of cool gas inflow toward six star-forming galaxies with redshifts z $\sim$ 0.35 - 1. Analysis of MgII and FeII resonance-line absorption in Keck/LRIS spectroscopy of this sample reveals velocity shifts of 80 - 200 km/s and equivalent widths for inflowing gas of >$\sim$ 0.6 Ang in five of the six objects. The host galaxies exhibit a wide range in star formation rates (SFR $\sim$ 1 - 40 M_sun/yr) and have stellar masses similar to that of the Milky Way (log M_*/M_sun $\sim$ 9.6 - 10.5). Imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys indicates that five of the six galaxies have highly inclined (i > 55 deg), disk-like morphologies. These data represent the first unambiguous detection of inflow into isolated, star-forming galaxies in the distant universe. We suggest that the inflow is due to the infall of enriched material from dwarf satellites and/or a galactic fountain within the galaxies. Assuming that the material has been enriched to 0.1Z_sun and has a physical extent approximately equal to that of the galaxies, we infer mass inflow rates of dM_in/dt >$\sim$ 0.2 - 3 M_sun/yr for four of these systems. Finally, from comparison of these absorption lines to the profiles of MgII and FeII absorption in a larger spectroscopic sample of $\sim$100 objects, we measure a covering fraction of cool inflow of at least 6%, but cannot rule out the presence of enriched infall onto as many as $\sim$40 of these galaxies.},

abstract = {This paper describes the data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II (SDSS-II) Supernova Survey conducted between 2005 and 2007. Light curves, spectra, classifications, and ancillary data are presented for 10,258 variable and transient sources discovered through repeat ugriz imaging of SDSS Stripe 82, a 300 deg2 area along the celestial equator. This data release is comprised of all transient sources brighter than r$\sim$22.5 mag with no history of variability prior to 2004. Dedicated spectroscopic observations were performed on a subset of 889 transients, as well as spectra for thousands of transient host galaxies using the SDSS-III BOSS spectrographs. Photometric classifications are provided for the candidates with good multi-color light curves that were not observed spectroscopically. From these observations, 4607 transients are either spectroscopically confirmed, or likely to be, supernovae, making this the largest sample of supernova candidates ever compiled. We present a new method for SN host-galaxy identification and derive host-galaxy properties including stellar masses, star-formation rates, and the average stellar population ages from our SDSS multi-band photometry. We derive SALT2 distance moduli for a total of 1443 SN Ia with spectroscopic redshifts as well as photometric redshifts for a further 677 purely-photometric SN Ia candidates. Using the spectroscopically confirmed subset of the three-year SDSS-II SN Ia sample and assuming a flat Lambda-CDM cosmology, we determine Omega_M = 0.315 +/- 0.093 (statistical error only) and detect a non-zero cosmological constant at 5.7 sigmas.},

abstract = {We measure star formation rates of $\sim$50,000 optically-selected galaxies in the local universe (z$\sim$0.1), spanning a range from gas-rich dwarfs to massive ellipticals. We obtain dust-corrected SFRs by fitting the GALEX (UV) and SDSS (optical) photometry to a library of population synthesis models that include dust attenuation. For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compare remarkably well with those derived from SDSS H alpha. Deviations from perfect agreement between these two methods are due to differences in the dust attenuation estimates. In contrast to H alpha, UV provides reliable SFRs for galaxies with weak or no H alpha emission, and where H alpha is contaminated with an emission from an AGN. We use full-SED SFRs to calibrate a simple prescription that uses GALEX UV magnitudes to produce good SFRs for normal star-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellar mass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGN, (2) those hosting an AGN, and for (3) galaxies without H alpha emission. We find that the three have distinct star formation histories, with AGN lying intermediate between the star-forming and the quiescent galaxies. Normal star forming galaxies (without an AGN) lie on a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong AGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. Weak AGN, while also massive, have lower SFR, sometimes extending to the realm of quiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxies that smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent (red sequence) galaxies via strong and weak AGN. We confirm that some galaxies with no H alpha emission show signs of SF in the UV. We derive a UV-based cosmic SFR density at z=0.1 with smaller total error than previous measurements (abridged).},

abstract = {We present a carefully selected sub-sample of Swift Long Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs), that is complete in redshift. The sample is constructed by considering only bursts with favorable observing conditions for ground-based follow-up searches, that are bright in the 15-150 keV Swift/BAT band, i.e. with 1-s peak photon fluxes in excess to 2.6 ph s^-1 cm^-2. The sample is composed by 58 bursts, 52 of them with redshift for a completeness level of 90%, while another two have a redshift constraint, reaching a completeness level of 95%. For only three bursts we have no constraint on the redshift. The high level of redshift completeness allows us for the first time to constrain the GRB luminosity function and its evolution with cosmic times in a unbiased way. We find that strong evolution in luminosity (d_l=2.3\pm 0.6) or in density (d_d=1.7\pm 0.5) is required in order to account for the observations. The derived redshift distribution in the two scenarios are consistent with each other, in spite of their different intrinsic redshift distribution. This calls for other indicators to distinguish among different evolution models. Complete samples are at the base of any population studies. In future works we will use this unique sample of Swift bright GRBs to study the properties of the population of long GRBs.},

abstract = {▪ Abstract At luminosities above 1011 , infrared galaxies become the dominant population of extragalactic objects in the local Universe (z ≲ 0.3), being more numerous than optically selected starburst and Seyfert galaxies and quasi-stellar objects at comparable bolometric luminosity. The trigger for the intense infrared emission appears to be the strong interaction/merger of molecular gas-rich spirals, and the bulk of the infrared luminosity for all but the most luminous objects is due to dust heating from an intense starburst within giant molecular clouds. At the highest luminosities (Lir > 1012 ), nearly all objects appear to be advanced mergers powered by a mixture of circumnuclear starburst and active galactic nucleus energy sources, both of which are fueled by an enormous concentration of molecular gas that has been funneled into the merger nucleus. These ultraluminous infrared galaxies may represent an important stage in the formation of quasi-stellar objects and powerful radio galaxies. They may al...},

abstract = {We present the first spectroscopic study of the host environments of TypeIbc supernovae (SNeIbc) discovered exclusively by untargeted SN searches. Past studies of SNIbc host environments have been biased toward high-mass, high-metallicity galaxies by focusing on SNe discovered in galaxy-targeted SN searches. Our new observations more than double the total number of spectroscopic stellar population age and metallicity measurements published for untargeted SNIbc host environments. For the 12 SNeIb and 21 SNeIc in our metallicity sample, we find median metallicities of 0.62 Z⊙ and 0.83 Z ⊙, respectively, but determine that the discrepancy in the full distribution of metallicities is not statistically significant. This median difference would correspond to only a small difference in the mass loss via metal-line-driven winds (≲ 30%), suggesting this does not play the dominant role in distinguishing SNeIb and Ic progenitors. However, the median metallicity of the seven broad-lined SNeIc (SNeIc-BL) in our sample is significantly lower, 0.45 Z ⊙. The age of the young stellar population of SNIc-BL host environments also seems to be lower than for SNeIb and Ic, but our age sample is small. Combining all SNIbc host environment spectroscopy from the literature to date does not reveal a significant difference in SNIb and Ic metallicities, but reinforces the significance of the lower metallicities for SNeIc-BL. This combined sample demonstrates that galaxy-targeted SN searches introduce a significant bias for studies seeking to infer the metallicity distribution of SN progenitors, and we identify and discuss other systematic effects that play smaller roles. We discuss the path forward for making progress on SNIbc progenitor studies in the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope era.

abstract = {Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are associated with the death of metal-poor massive stars. Even though they are highly transient events very hard to localize, they are so bright that they can be detected in the most difficult environments. GRB observations are unveiling a surprising view of the chemical state of the distant universe (redshifts z > 2). Contrary to what is expected for a high-z metal-poor star, the neutral interstellar medium (ISM) around GRBs is not metal poor (metallicities vary from $\sim$1/10 solar at z = 6.3 to about solar at z = 2) and is enriched with dust (90-99% of iron is in solid form). If these metallicities are combined with those measured in the warm ISM of GRB host galaxies at z < 1, a redshift evolution is observed. Such an evolution predicts that the stellar masses of the hosts are in the range M* = 10^(8.6-9.8) Msun. This prediction makes use of the mass-metallicity relation (and its redshift evolution) observed in normal star-forming galaxies. Independent measurements coming from the optical-NIR photometry of GRB hosts indicate the same range of stellar masses, with a typical value similar to that of the Large Magellanic Cloud. This newly detected population of intermediate-mass galaxies is very hard to find at high redshift using conventional astronomy. However, it offers a compelling and relatively inexpensive opportunity to explore galaxy formation and cosmic chemical evolution beyond known borders, from the primordial universe to the present.},

abstract = {The Damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) systems are absorption line systems observed toward QSO lines of sight and probe the interstellar medium in galaxies from the local Universe up to the z $\sim$4 Universe. The large amount of high resolution QSO spectroscopy that is available now allows us to measure the metallicity in these galaxies and track the redshift evolution. We have collected line measurements of 69 DLAs in the redshift range 0 < z < 4.4, measured the abundances for different elements, corrected for dust depletion, and studied the redshift distribution. We have found that the whole sample shows a strong correlation with redshift (99.99% significance level), indicating that these galaxies are chemically evolving with time. We also have found that the distribution of low HI column density DLAs is much more homogeneous than the high HI column density DLAs, the latter being more concentrated in the central redshift interval. As a consequence, the total sample cannot be used to study the global metallicity evolution in the Universe, assumed to be given by the ratio of the total metal content to the total gas content in a given redshift bin, because the underlining evolution might be masked by the incompleteness of the high HI column density DLA sample. In conclusion, even if we have demonstrated that the metallicity in DLA galaxies evolves, the statistics of DLAs is too poor to probe the global metallicity evolution of the Universe.},

abstract = {We present the most extensive and complete study of the properties for the largest sample (46 objects) of gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxies. The redshift interval and the mean redshift of the sample are 0<z<6.3 and z=0.96 (look-back time: 7.2 Gyr), respectively; 89% of the hosts are at z <$\sim$ 1.6. Optical-near-infrared (NIR) photometry and spectroscopy are used to derive stellar masses, star formation rates (SFRs), dust extinctions and metallicities. The average stellar mass is 10^9.3 M_sun, with a 1 sigma dispersion of 0.8 dex. The average metallicity for a subsample of 17 hosts is about 1/6 solar and the dust extinction in the visual band (for a subsample of 10 hosts) is A_V=0.5. We obtain new relations to derive SFR from [OII] or UV fluxes, when Balmer emission lines are not available. SFRs, corrected for dust extinction, aperture-slit loss and stellar Balmer absorption are in the range 0.01-36 M_sun yr^-1. The median SFR per unit stellar mass (specific SFR) is 0.8 Gyr^-1. Equivalently the inverse quantity, the median formation timescale is 1.3 Gyr. Most GRBs are associated with the death of young massive stars, more common in star-forming galaxies. Therefore GRBs are an effective tool to detect star-forming galaxies in the universe. Star-forming galaxies at z<1.6 are a faint and low-mass population, hard to detect by conventional optical-NIR surveys, unless a GRB event occurs. There is no compelling evidence that GRB hosts are peculiar galaxies. More data on the subclass of short GRB are necessary to establish the nature of their hosts.},

abstract = {We report on the surprisingly high metallicity measured in two absorption systems at high redshift, detected in the Very Large Telescope spectrum of the afterglow of the gamma-ray burst (GRB) GRB 090323. The two systems, at redshift z= 3.5673 and 3.5774 (separation $\Delta$v≈ 660 km s-1), are dominated by the neutral gas in the interstellar medium of the parent galaxies. From the singly ionized zinc and sulphur, we estimate oversolar metallicities of [Zn/H] =+0.29 ± 0.10 and [S/H] = +0.67 ± 0.34, in the blue and red absorber, respectively. These are the highest metallicities ever measured in galaxies at z > 3. We propose that the two systems trace two galaxies in the process of merging, whose star formation and metallicity are heightened by the interaction. This enhanced star formation might also have triggered the birth of the GRB progenitor. As typically seen in star-forming galaxies, the fine-structure absorption Si II* is detected, both in z= 3.5774 ± 0.0005 and 3.5673 ± 0.0003. From the rest-frame ultraviolet emission in the GRB location, we derive a relatively high, not corrected for dust extinction, star formation rate ≈6 M⊙ yr-1. These properties suggest a possible connection between some high-redshift GRB host galaxies and high-z massive submillimetre galaxies, which are characterized by disturbed morphologies and high metallicities. Our result provides additional evidence that the dispersion in the chemical enrichment of the Universe at high redshift is substantial, with the existence of very metal-rich galaxies less than two billion years after the big bang.

abstract = {We have derived the column densities of heavy elements in three gamma-ray burst (GRB) optical transients, associated iwth the circumburst or interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxy. In comparison with the same elements observed in damped Ly-alpha (DLA) systems along QSO sight lines, we find evidence for much higher column densities of Zn II. The gap between the QSO-DLA and GRB-DLA distributions is smoothly bridged by observations of the interstellar absorption in the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds. Very small [Fe/Zn], [Si/Zn], and [Cr/Zn] values in GRB-DLAs indicate large dust depletions. Once the dust-to-metals ratios are determined, we find an optical extinction A_V $\sim$ 1 mag, to be compared with typical A_V <$\sim$ 0.1 in most QSO-DLAs. Our inference of high dust content appears to be in contradiction with the typical low reddening previously found in GRBs. One possible way to reconcile is a dust grain size distribution biased toward big grains, which would give a gray extinction. Possibly, the small dust grains have been destroyed by the GRBs themselves. Our ifndings support the idea that primarily optically selected QSOs probe mainly low-gas/dust regions of high-redshift galaxies, while the more powerful GRBs can be detected through denser regions of their ISM (molecular clouds and star-forming regions). Therefore, GRB-DLAs and QSO-DLAs together provide a more complete picture of the global properties of the interstellar medium in high-redshift galaxies.},

abstract = {I present a suite of three-dimensional simulations of the evolution of initially-hot material ejected by starburst-driven galaxy outflows. The simulations are conducted in a comoving frame that moves with the material, tracking atomic/ionic cooling, Compton cooling, and dust cooling and destruction. Compton cooling is most efficient of these processes, while the main role of atomic/ionic cooling is to enhance density inhomogeneities. Dust, on the other hand, has little effect on the outflow evolu-tion, and is rapidly destroyed in all the simulations except the case with the smallest mass flux. I use the results to construct a simple steady-state model of the observed UV/optical emission from each outflow. The velocity profiles in this case are dominated by geometric effects, and the over-all luminosities are extremely strong functions of the properties of the host system, as observed in ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). Furthermore the luminosities and maximum velocities in several models are consistent with emission-line observations of ULIRGs, although the velocities are significantly greater than observed in absorption-line studies. It may be that absorption line observa-tions of galaxy outflows probe entrained cold material at small radii, while emission-line observations probe cold material condensing from the initially hot medium at larger distances.},

We fit the parameters of this model to the local observations of Mannucci and collaborators and then study its impact on three important problems. On cosmic scales, the model reproduces the observed SNe Ia rate density below z=1, and predicts that it will track the measured SFR density at higher redshift, reaching a value of 1-3.5 X 10^-4 per yr per Mpc^3 at z=2. In galaxy clusters, a large prompt contribution helps explain the iron content of the intracluster medium. Within the Galaxy, the model reproduces the observed stellar [O/Fe] abundance ratios if we allow a short (approximately 0.7 Gyr) delay in the prompt component.

abstract = {The composition and amount of interstellar dust within gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxies is of key importance when addressing selection effects in the GRB redshift distribution, and when studying the properties of their host galaxies. As well as the implications for GRB research, probing the dust within the high-z hosts of GRBs also contributes to our understanding of the conditions of the interstellar medium and star-formation in the distant Universe. Nevertheless, the physical properties of dust within GRB host galaxies continues to be a highly contended issue. In this paper we explore the mean extinction properties of dust within the host galaxies of a sample of 17 GRBs with total host galaxy visual extinction Av<1 (<Av>=0.4), covering a redshift range z=0.7-3.1. We find the average host extinction curve to have an ultraviolet slope comparable to that of the LMC, but with little evidence of a 2175Angs dust extinction feature as observed along Milky Way and LMC sightlines. We cannot at present rule out the presence of a 2175Angs feature, and both the standard SMC and LMC extinction curves also provide good fits to our data. However, we can reject an extinction curve that has a UV slope as flat as the mean Milky Way extinction curve, whilst also having a 2175Angs feature as prominent as seen in the mean Milky Way extinction curve. This is in contrast to the clear detection of a 2175Angs bump and the flatter extinction curves of some more heavily extinguished GRBs (Av>1), which may be indicative of there being a dependence between dust abundance and the wavelength dependence of dust extinction, as has been previously speculated.},

Validating these predictions requires large numbers of ccSNe of different types with measured M0, which is challenging. In this paper, we explore the reliability of using host galaxy emission lines and the H $\alpha$ equivalent width to constrain the age, and thus the M0 of ccSNe progenitors. We use Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis models to infer a stellar population age from MUSE observations of the ionized gas properties and H $\alpha$ EW at the location of eleven ccSNe with reliable M0 measurements. Comparing our results to published M0 values, we find that models that do not consider binary systems yield stellar ages that are systematically too young (thus M0 too large), whereas accounting for binary system interactions typically overpredict the stellar age (thus underpredict M0). Taking into account the effects of photon leakage bring our M0 estimates in much closer agreement with expectations. These results highlight the need for careful modelling of diffuse environments, such as are present in the vicinity of Type II SNe, before ionized emission line spectra can be used as reliable tracers of progenitor stellar age.</p>},

abstract = {Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are indisputably related to star formation, and their vast luminosity in gamma rays pin-points regions of star formation independent of galaxy mass, out to the epoch of re-ionisation. As such, GRBs provide a unique tool for studying star forming galaxies out to high-z independent of luminosity. Most of our understanding of the properties of GRB hosts (GRBHs) comes from optical and near-infrared follow-up observations, and we therefore have relatively little knowledge of the fraction of dust-enshrouded star formation that resides within GRBHs. Currently $\sim$20% of GRBs show evidence of significant amounts of dust within their host galaxy along the GRB line of sight, and these GRBs tend to reside within redder and more massive galaxies than GRBs with optically bright afterglows. In this paper we present Herschel observations of five GRBHs with evidence of being dust-rich, targeted to understand the properties of the dust attenuation within GRBs better. Despite the sensitivity of our Herschel observations, only one galaxy in our sample was detected (GRBH 070306), for which we measure a total star formation rate of $\sim$100 M⊙ yr-1, and which had a relatively high stellar mass (log[M*] = 10.34+0.09-0.04. Nevertheless, when considering a larger sample of GRBHs observed with Herschel, it is clear that stellar mass is not the only factor contributing to a Herschel detection, and significant dust extinction along the GRB sightline (AV,GRB> 1.5 mag) appears to be a considerably better tracer of GRBHs with a high dust mass. This suggests that the extinguishing dust along the GRB line of sight lies predominantly within the host galaxy ISM, and thus those GRBs with AV,GRB> 1 mag but with no host galaxy Herschel detections are likely to have been predominantly extinguished by dust within an intervening dense cloud.},

abstract = {There is considerable discrepancy between the amount of X-ray absorption and what is inferred from optical (rest frame UV) as measured along gamma-ray burst (GRB) sight lines, with the former typically an order of magnitude higher than what would be expected from the measurement of neutral element species via optical absorption line spectroscopy. We explored this " missing gas problem " in a sample of 29 GRBs with redshifts in the range 0.7–6.3 by studying the X-ray and optical spectra, as well as the afterglow broadband spectral energy distributions. The low ionisation species detected in the UV are associated with the neutral interstellar medium in the GRB host galaxy, while soft X-ray absorption, which is weakly dependent on the ionisation state of the gas, provides a probe of the total column of gas along the sight line. After careful consideration of any systematic effects, we find that the neutral gas consists of 10% of the total gas, and this limit decreases the more ionised the X-ray absorbing gas is, which in our spectral fits is assumed to be neutral. Only a very small fraction of this ionised gas, however, is detected in UV absorption lines with ionisation potentials up to ∼200 eV (i.e. Si iv, C iv, N v, O vi), which leaves us to postulate that the X-ray excess comes from ultra-highly-ionised, dense gas in the GRB vicinity.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} ESO 2015. Over the last decade there has been immense progress in the follow-up of short and long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), resulting in a significant rise in the detection rate of X-ray and optical afterglows, in the determination of GRB redshifts, and of the identification of the underlying host galaxies. Nevertheless, our theoretical understanding of the progenitors and central engines powering these vast explosions is lagging behind, and a newly identified class of ultra-long GRBs has fuelled speculation on the existence of a new channel of GRB formation. In this paper we present high signal-to-noise X-Shooter observations of the host galaxy of GRB 130925A, which is the fourth unambiguously identified ultra-long GRB, with prompt $\gamma$-ray emission detected for $\sim$20 ks. The GRB line of sight was close to the host galaxy nucleus, and our spectroscopic observations cover this region along the bulge/disk of the galaxy and a bright star-forming region within the outskirts of the galaxy. From our broad wavelength coverage, we obtain accurate metallicity and dust-extinction measurements at the galaxy nucleus and at an outer star-forming region, and measure a super-solar metallicity at both locations, placing this galaxy within the 10-20% most metal-rich GRB host galaxies. Such a high metal enrichment has significant implications on the progenitor models of both long and ultra-long GRBs, although the edge-on orientation of the host galaxy does not allow us to rule out a large metallicity variation along our line of sight. The spatially resolved spectroscopic observations presented in this paper offer important insight into variations in the metal and dust abundance within GRB host galaxies. However, they also illustrate the need for integral field unit observations on a larger sample of GRB host galaxies of a variety of metallicities to provide a more quantitative view on the relation between the GRB circumburst environment and the galaxy-whole properties.},

abstract = {Using a sample of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows detected by both the X-Ray and the UV/Optical Telescopes (XRT and UVOT) on Swift, we modelled the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to determine gas column densities and dust extinction in the GRB local environment. In six out of seven cases we find an X-ray absorber associated with the GRB host galaxy with column density (assuming solar abundances) ranging from (0.8 - 7.7)x10^{21}cm^{-2}. We determine the rest-frame visual extinction A_V using the SMC, LMC and Galactic extinction curves to model the dust in the GRB host galaxy, and this ranges from A_V = 0.12\pm 0.04 to A_V = 0.65^{+0.08}_{-0.07}. The afterglow SEDs were typically best fit by a model with an SMC extinction curve. In only one case was the GRB afterglow better modelled by a Galactic extinction curve, which has a prominent absorption feature at 2175angstrom. We investigate the selection effects present in our sample and how these might distort the true distribution of A_V in GRB host galaxies. We estimate that GRBs with no afterglow detected blueward of 5500angstrom have average rest-frame visual extinctions almost eight times those observed in the optically bright population of GRBs. This may help account for the $\sim$1/3 of GRBs observed by Swift that have no afterglow detected by UVOT.},

abstract = {In this paper we present the results from the analysis of a sample of 28 gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow spectral energy distributions, spanning the X-ray through to near-infrared wavelengths. This is the largest sample of GRB afterglow spectral energy distributions thus far studied, providing a strong handle on the optical depth distribution of soft X-ray absorption and dust-extinction systems in GRB host galaxies. We detect an absorption system within the GRB host galaxy in 79% of the sample, and an extinction system in 71% of the sample, and find the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) extinction law to provide an acceptable fit to the host galaxy extinction profile for the majority of cases, consistent with previous findings. The range in the soft X-ray absorption to dust-extinction ratio, N_{H,X}/Av, in GRB host galaxies spans almost two orders of magnitude, and the typical ratios are significantly larger than those of the Magellanic Clouds or Milky Way. Although dust destruction could be a cause, at least in part, for the large N_{H,X}/Av ratios, the good fit provided by the SMC extinction law for the majority of our sample suggests that there is an abundance of small dust grains in the GRB environment, which we would expect to have been destroyed if dust destruction were responsible for the large N_{H,X}/Av ratios. Instead, our analysis suggests that the distribution of N_{H,X}/Av in GRB host galaxies may be mostly intrinsic to these galaxies, and this is further substantiated by evidence for a strong negative correlation between N_{H,X}/Av and metallicity for a subsample of GRB hosts with known metallicity. Furthermore, we find the N_{H,X}/Av ratio and metallicity for this subsample of GRBs to be comparable to the relation found in other more metal-rich galaxies.},

abstract = {We present spectra of the optical transient of GRB021004 obtained with the Hobby-Eberly telescope starting 15.48, 20.31 hours, and 4.84 days after the burst and a spectrum obtained with the H. J. Smith 2.7 m Telescope starting 14.31 hours after the burst. GRB021004 is the first afterglow whose spectrum is dominated by absorption lines from high ionization species with multiple velocity components separated by up to 3000 km/s. We argue that these lines are likely to come from shells around a massive progenitor star. The high velocities and high ionizations arise from a combination of acceleration and flash-ionization by the burst photons and the wind velocity and steady ionization by the progenitor. We also analyze the broad-band spectrum and the light curve. We distinguish six components along the line of sight: (1) The z$\sim$2.293 absorption lines arise from the wind of a massive star. For a mass loss rate of $\sim$6 x 10^{-5} solar masses per year, this component also provides the external medium to create the afterglow light. (2) A second shell produces absorption lines with a relative velocity of 560 km/s, and this is associated with the shell created by the fast massive star wind blowing a bubble in the preceding slow wind at a radial distance of order 10 pc. (3) More distant clouds within the host galaxy lie between 30-2500 pc, where they have been ionized by the burst. (4-6) The massive star wind has clumps with radii and over-densities of 0.022, 0.063, and 0.12 parsecs and 50%, 10%, and 10% respectively. The immediate progenitor of the burster could either be a WC-type Wolf-Rayet star or a highly evolved star whose original mass was just too small for it to become a WN-type Wolf-Rayet star.},

abstract = {We present a full sky 100 micron map that is a reprocessed composite of the COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA maps, with the zodiacal foreground and confirmed point sources removed. Before using the ISSA maps, we remove the remaining artifacts from the IRAS scan pattern. Using the DIRBE 100 micron and 240 micron data, we have constructed a map of the dust temperature, so that the 100 micron map can be converted to a map proportional to dust column density. The result of these manipulations is a map with DIRBE-quality calibration and IRAS resolution. To generate the full sky dust maps, we must first remove zodiacal light contamination as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). This is done via a regression analysis of the 100 micron DIRBE map against the Leiden- Dwingeloo map of H_I emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a suitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 micron flux. For the 100 micron map, no significant CIB is detected. In the 140 micron and 240 micron maps, where the zodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the CIB at surprisingly high flux levels of 32 \pm 13 nW/m^2/sr at 140 micron, and 17 \pm 4 nW/m^2/sr at 240 micron (95% confidence). This integrated flux is $\sim$2 times that extrapolated from optical galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field. The primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of Galactic extinction. We demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the older Burstein-Heiles estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening. These dust maps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminates CMBR experiments and for estimating soft X-ray absorption.},

Our collaboration has pursued a basic understanding of supernovae in the nearby Universe, discovering and observing a large sample of objects, and developing methods to measure accurate distances with SN Ia. This paper describes the extension of this program to $z \geq 0.2$, outlining our search techniques and follow-up program. We have devised high-throughput filters which provide accurate two-color restframe $B$ and $V$ light curves of SN Ia, enabling us to produce precise, extinction-corrected luminosity distances in the range $0.25 < z < 0.55$. Sources of systematic error from K-corrections, extinction, selection effects, and evolution are investigated, and their effects estimated. We present photometric and spectral observations of SN 1995K, our program's first supernova, and use the data to obtain a precise measurement of the luminosity distance to the $z=0.479$ host galaxy. This object, when combined with a nearby sample of SN, yields an estimate for the matter density of the Universe of $\Omega_M = -0.2^{+1.0}_{-0.8}$ if $\Omega_\Lambda = 0$. For a spatially flat universe composed of normal matter and a cosmological constant, we find $\Omega_M = 0.4^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$, $\Omega_\Lambda = 0.6^{+0.4}_{-0.5}$. We demonstrate that with a sample of $\sim 30$ objects, we should be able to determine relative luminosity distances over the range $0 < z< 0.5$ with sufficient precision to measure $\Omega_M$ with an uncertainty of $\pm 0.2$.},

abstract = {Although dust content is usually assumed to depend uniquely on metallicity, recent observations of two extremely metal-poor dwarf galaxies have suggested that this may not always be true. At a similar oxygen abundance of $\sim$ 3% Zsun, the dust-to-gas and dust-to-stellar mass ratios in SBS 0335-052 and IZw 18 differ by a factor 40-70 according to including molecular gas or excluding it. Here we investigate a possible reason for this dramatic difference through models based on a semi-analytical formulation of chemical evolution including dust. Results suggest that the greater dust mass in SBS 0335-052 is due to the more efficient grain growth allowed by the high density in the cold interstellar medium (ISM), observationally inferred to be almost 20 times higher than in IZw 18. Our models are able to explain the difference in dust masses, suggesting that efficient dust formation and dust content in galaxies, including those with the highest measured redshifts, depend sensitively on the ISM density, rather than only on metallicity.},

abstract = {Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) offer a route to characterizing star-forming galaxies and quantifying high-$z$ star formation that is distinct from the approach of traditional galaxy surveys: GRB selection is independent of dust and probes even the faintest galaxies that can evade detection in flux-limited surveys. However, the exact relation between the GRB rate and the star formation rate (SFR) throughout all redshifts is controversial. The Optically Unbiased GRB Host (TOUGH) survey includes observations of all GRB hosts (69) in an optically unbiased sample of Swift GRBs and we utilize these to constrain the evolution of the UV GRB-host-galaxy luminosity function (LF) between $z=0$ and $z=4.5$, and compare this with LFs derived from both Lyman-break galaxy (LBG) surveys and simulation modeling. At all redshifts we find the GRB hosts to be most consistent with a luminosity function derived from SFR weighted models incorporating GRB production via both metallicity-dependent and independent channels with a relatively high level of bias toward low metallicity hosts. In the range $1<z<3$ an SFR weighted LBG derived (i.e., non-metallicity biased) LF is also a reasonable fit to the data. Between $z\sim3$ and $z\sim6$, we observe an apparent lack of UV bright hosts in comparison with LBGs, though the significance of this shortfall is limited by nine hosts of unknown redshift.},

abstract = {We present optical light curves, redshifts, and classifications for 365 spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered by the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) Medium Deep Survey. We detail improvements to the PS1 SN photometry, astrometry and calibration that reduce the systematic uncertainties in the PS1 SN Ia distances. We combine the subset of 279 PS1 SN Ia ($0.03 < z < 0.68$) with useful distance estimates of SN Ia from SDSS, SNLS, various low-z and HST samples to form the largest combined sample of SN Ia consisting of a total of 1048 SN Ia ranging from $0.01 < z < 2.3$, which we call the `Pantheon Sample'. When combining Planck 2015 CMB measurements with the Pantheon SN sample, we find $\Omega_m=0.307\pm0.012$ and $w = -1.026\pm0.041$ for the wCDM model. When the SN and CMB constraints are combined with constraints from BAO and local H0 measurements, the analysis yields the most precise measurement of dark energy to date: $w0 = -1.007\pm 0.089$ and $wa = -0.222 \pm0.407$ for the w0waCDM model. Tension with a cosmological constant previously seen in an analysis of PS1 and low-z SNe has diminished after an increase of $2\times$ in the statistics of the PS1 sample, improved calibration and photometry, and stricter light-curve quality cuts. We find the systematic uncertainties in our measurements of dark energy are almost as large as the statistical uncertainties, primarily due to limitations of modeling the low-redshift sample. This must be addressed for future progress in using SN Ia to measure dark energy.},

abstract = {We predict cosmological constraints for forthcoming surveys using superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) as standardizable candles. Due to their high peak luminosity, these events can be observed to high redshift (z ∼ 3), opening up new possibilities to probe the Universe in the deceleration epoch. We describe our methodology for creating mock Hubble diagrams for the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the 'Search Using DECam for Superluminous Supernovae' (SUDSS) and a sample of SLSNe possible from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), exploring a range of standardization values for SLSNe. We include uncertainties due to gravitational lensing and marginalize over possible uncertainties in the magnitude scale of the observations (e.g. uncertain absolute peak magnitude, calibration errors). We find that the addition of only SLSNe from SUDSS to 3800 Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) from DES can improve the constraints on w and m by at least 20 per cent (assuming a flat wCDM universe). Moreover, the combination of DES SNe Ia and 10 000 LSST-like SLSNe can measure m and w to 2 and 4 per cent, respectively. The real power of SLSNe becomes evident when we consider possible temporal variations in w(a), giving possible uncertainties of only 2, 5 and 14 per cent on m , w 0 and w a , respectively, from the combination of DES SNe Ia, LSST-like SLSNe and Planck. These errors are competitive with predicted Euclid constraints, indicating a future role for SLSNe for probing the high-redshift Universe.},

abstract = {We present the results of a near-infrared imaging survey of z$\sim$3 Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs). The survey covers a total of 30 arcmin^2 and includes 118 photometrically selected LBGs with K_s band measurements, 63 of which also have J band measurements, and 81 of which have spectroscopic redshifts. Using the distribution of optical {\cal R} magnitudes from previous work and {\cal R}-K_s colors for this sub-sample, we compute the rest-frame optical luminosity function of LBGs. At the brightest magnitudes, where it is fairly well constrained, this luminosity function strikingly exceeds locally determined optical luminosity functions. The V-band luminosity density of only the observed bright end of the z$\sim$3 LBG luminosity function already approaches that of all stars in the local universe. For the 81 galaxies with measured redshifts, we investigate the range of LBG stellar populations implied by the photometry which generally spans the range 900--5500 AA in the rest-frame. While there are only weak constraints on the parameters for most of the individual galaxies, there are strong trends in the sample as a whole. A unified scenario which accounts for the observed trends in bright LBGs is one in which a relatively short period of very rapid star-formation (hundreds of M_sun/yr) lasts for roughly 50--100 Myr, after which both the extinction and star-formation rate are considerably reduced and stars are formed at a more quiescent, but still rapid, rate for at least a few hundred Myr. In our sample, a considerable fraction ($\sim$20%) of the LBGs have best-fit star-formation ages $\sim$> 1 Gyr, implied stellar masses of $\sim$> 10^10 M_sun, and are still forming stars at \$\sim$30 M_sun/yr.},

abstract = {We present the results of a systematic study of the rest-frame UV spectroscopic properties of Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs). The database of almost 1000 LBG spectra proves useful for constructing high S/N composite spectra. The composite spectrum of the entire sample reveals a wealth of features attributable to hot stars, HII regions, dust, and outflowing neutral and ionized gas. By grouping the database according to galaxy parameters such as Lyman-alpha equivalent width, UV spectral slope, and interstellar kinematics, we isolate some of the major trends in LBG spectra which are least compromised by selection effects. We find that LBGs with stronger Lyman-alpha emission have bluer UV continua, weaker low-ionization interstellar absorption lines, smaller kinematic offsets between Lyman-alpha and the interstellar absorption lines, and lower star-formation rates. There is a decoupling between the dependence of low- and high-ionization outflow features on other spectral properties. Most of the above trends can be explained in terms of the properties of the large-scale outflows seen in LBGs. According to this scenario, the appearance of LBG spectra is determined by a combination of the covering fraction of outflowing neutral gas which contains dust, and the range of velocities over which this gas is absorbing. Higher sensitivity and spectral resolution observations are still required for a full understanding of the covering fraction and velocity dispersion of the outflowing neutral gas in LBGs, and its relationship to the escape fraction of Lyman continuum radiation in galaxies at z$\sim$3.},

abstract = {Context. The interaction of the light from astronomical objects with the constituents of the Earth's atmosphere leads to the formation of telluric absorption lines in ground-based collected spectra. Correcting for these lines, mostly affecting the red and infrared region of the spectrum, usually relies on observations of specific stars obtained close in time and airmass to the science targets, therefore using precious observing time.  Aims: We present molecfit, a tool to correct for telluric absorption lines based on synthetic modelling of the Earth's atmospheric transmission. Molecfit is versatile and can be used with data obtained with various ground-based telescopes and instruments.  Methods: Molecfit combines a publicly available radiative transfer code, a molecular line database, atmospheric profiles, and various kernels to model the instrument line spread function. The atmospheric profiles are created by merging a standard atmospheric profile representative of a given observatory's climate, of local meteorological data, and of dynamically retrieved altitude profiles for temperature, pressure, and humidity. We discuss the various ingredients of the method, its applicability, and its limitations. We also show examples of telluric line correction on spectra obtained with a suite of ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) instruments.  Results: Compared to previous similar tools, molecfit takes the best results for temperature, pressure, and humidity in the atmosphere above the observatory into account. As a result, the standard deviation of the residuals after correction of unsaturated telluric lines is frequently better than 2% of the continuum.  Conclusions: Molecfit is able to accurately model and correct for telluric lines over a broad range of wavelengths and spectral resolutions. The accuracy reached is comparable to or better than the typical accuracy achieved using a telluric standard star observation. The availability of such a general tool for telluric absorption correction may improve future observational and analysing strategies, as well as empower users of archival data.

abstract = {We present DES14X3taz, a new hydrogen-poor super luminous supernova (SLSN-I) discovered by the Dark Energy Survey (DES) supernova program, with additional photometric data provided by the Survey Using DECam for Superluminous Supernovae (SUDSS). Spectra obtained using OSIRIS on the Gran Telescopio CANARIAS (GTC) show DES14X3taz is a SLSN-I at z=0.608. Multi-color photometry reveals a double-peaked light curve: a blue and relatively bright initial peak that fades rapidly prior to the slower rise of the main light curve. Our multi-color photometry allows us, for the first time, to show that the initial peak cools from 22,000K to 8,000K over 15 rest-frame days, and is faster and brighter than any published core-collapse supernova, reaching 30% of the bolometric luminosity of the main peak. No physical Nickel powered model can fit this initial peak. We show that a shock-cooling model followed by a magnetar driving the second phase of the light curve can adequately explain the entire light curve of DES14X3taz. Models involving the shock-cooling of extended circumstellar material at a distance of $\sim$400 solar radii are preferred over the cooling of shock-heated surface layers of a stellar envelope. We compare DES14X3taz to the few double-peaked SLSN-I events in the literature. Although the rise-times and characteristics of these initial peaks differ, there exists the tantalizing possibility that they can be explained by one physical interpretation.},

abstract = {We present improved photometric measurements for the host galaxies of 206 spectroscopically confirmed type Ia supernovae discovered by the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program (DES-SN) and used in the first DES-SN cosmological analysis. For the DES-SN sample, when considering a 5D (z, x1, c, $\alpha$, $\beta$) bias correction, we find evidence of a Hubble residual ‘mass step', where SNe Ia in high-mass galaxies (>1010M⊙) are intrinsically more luminous (after correction) than their low-mass counterparts by $\gamma =0.040\pm 0.019$ mag. This value is larger by 0.031 mag than the value found in the first DES-SN cosmological analysis. This difference is due to a combination of updated photometric measurements and improved star formation histories and is not from host-galaxy misidentification. When using a 1D (redshift-only) bias correction the inferred mass step is larger, with $\gamma =0.066\pm 0.020$ mag. The 1D−5D $\gamma$ difference for DES-SN is $0.026\pm 0.009$ mag. We show that this difference is due to a strong correlation between host galaxy stellar mass and the x1 component of the 5D distance-bias correction. Including an intrinsic correlation between the observed properties of SNe Ia, stretch and colour, and stellar mass in simulated SN Ia samples, we show that a 5D fit recovers $\gamma$ with −9 mmag bias compared to a +2 mmag bias for a 1D fit. This difference can explain part of the discrepancy seen in the data. Improvements in modelling correlations between galaxy properties and SN is necessary to ensure unbiased precision estimates of the dark energy equation of state as we enter the era of LSST.},

abstract = {We propose a common envelope jets supernova (CEJSN) scenario for the fast-rising blue optical transient AT2018cow. In a CEJSN, a neutron star (NS) spirals-in inside the extended envelope of a massive giant star and enters the core. The NS accretes mass from the core through an accretion disc and launches jets. These jets explode the core and the envelope. In the specific polar CEJSN scenario that we propose here, the jets clear the polar regions of the giant star before the NS enters the core. The jets that the NS launches after it enters the core expand almost freely along the polar directions that contain a small amount of mass. This, we suggest, explains the fast rise to maximum and the fast ejecta observed at early times of the enigmatic transient AT2018cow. The slower later time ejecta are the more massive equatorial outflow. We roughly estimate the accretion phase on to the NS during the explosion phase to last for a time of approx 10 3 , mathrms, during which the average mass accretion rate is approx 10 -4 , mathrmM-odot , mathrms -1. We outline the possible diversity of CEJSNe by listing five other scenarios in addition to the polar CEJSN scenario.},

abstract = {Using a compilation of 25 studies from the literature, we investigate the evolution of the star-forming galaxy (SFG) Main Sequence (MS) in stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) out to $z \sim 6$. After converting all observations to a common set of calibrations, we find a remarkable consensus among MS observations ($\sim 0.1$ dex 1$\sigma$ interpublication scatter). By fitting for time evolution of the MS in bins of constant mass, we deconvolve the observed scatter about the MS within each observed redshift bins. After accounting for observed scatter between different SFR indicators, we find the width of the MS distribution is $\sim 0.2$ dex and remains constant over cosmic time. Our best fits indicate the slope of the MS is likely time-dependent, with our best fit $\log\textrm{SFR}(M_*,t) = \left(0.84 \pm 0.02 - 0.026 \pm 0.003 \times t\right) \log M_* - \left(6.51 \pm 0.24 - 0.11 \pm 0.03 \times t\right)$, with $t$ the age of the Universe in Gyr. We use our fits to create empirical evolutionary tracks in order to constrain MS galaxy star formation histories (SFHs), finding that (1) the most accurate representations of MS SFHs are given by delayed-$\tau$ models, (2) the decline in fractional stellar mass growth for a "typical" MS galaxy today is approximately linear for most of its lifetime, and (3) scatter about the MS can be generated by galaxies evolving along identical evolutionary tracks assuming an initial $1\sigma$ spread in formation times of $\sim 1.4$ Gyr.},

abstract = {The host galaxies of the five local, z<0.25, long-duration gamma-ray bursts, each of which had a well-documented associated supernova, are all faint and metal-poor compared to the population of local star-forming galaxies. We quantify this statement by using a previous analysis of star-forming galaxies (z<0.2) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to estimate the fraction of local star formation as a function of host galaxy oxygen abundance. We find that only a small fraction (<25%) of current star formation occurs in galaxies with oxygen abundance 12+log(O/H)<8.6, i.e., about half that of the Milky Way. However, all five low-z GRB hosts have oxygen abundance below this limit, in three cases very significantly so. If GRBs traced local star formation independent of metallicity, the probability of obtaining such low abundances for all five hosts would be P$\sim$0.1%. We conclude that GRBs trace only low-metallicity star formation, and that the Milky Way has been too metal rich to host long GRBs for at least the last several billion years. This result has implications for the potential role of GRBs in mass extinctions, for searches for recent burst remnants in the Milky Way and other large galaxies, for non-detections of late radio emission from local core-collapse supernovae, and for the production of cosmic rays in the local Universe. We also find that the isotropic energy release of these five GRBs, E_iso, steeply decreases with increasing host oxygen abundance, suggesting an upper metallicity limit for ``cosmological'' GRBs at $\sim$0.15 Z_solar.

For this sample we derive the values of the injected electron energy distribution index, p, and the density structure index of the circumburst medium, k, fromsimultaneous spectral fits to their X-ray, optical, and NIR afterglow data. The spectral fits have been done in count space and include the effects of metallicity, and are compared with the previously reported optical and X-ray temporal behavior. Using the blast wave model and some assump- tions which include on-axis viewing and standard jet structure, constant blast wave energy, and no evolution of the microphysical parameters, we find a mean value of p for the sample as a whole of 2:04^{+0:02}_{-0.03}. A statistica analysis of the distribution demonstrates that the p-values in this sample are inconsistent with a single universal value for p at the 3 sigma level or greater, which has significant implications for particle acceleration models. This approach provides us a measured distribution of circumburst density structures rather than consitering only the cases of k = 0 (homogeneous) and k = 2 (windlike). We find five GRBs for which k can be well constrained, and in four of these cases the circumburst medium is clearly windlike. The fifth source has a value of 0 <= k <= 1, consistent with a homogeneous circumburst medium.},

We show unambiguously that the locus of z$\sim$2.3 galaxies in the "BPT" nebular diagnostic diagram exhibits a disjoint, yet similarly tight, relationship between the ratios [NII]6585/Halpha and [OIII]/Hbeta as compared to local galaxies. Using photoionization models, we argue that the offset of the z$\sim$2.3 locus relative to z$\sim$ 0 is explained by a combination of harder ionizing radiation field, higher ionization parameter, and higher N/O at a given O/H than applies to most local galaxies, and that the position of a galaxy along the z$\sim$2.3 star-forming BPT locus is surprisingly insensitive to gas-phase oxygen abundance. The observed nebular emission line ratios are most easily reproduced by models in which the net ionizing radiation field resembles a blackbody with effective temperature T_eff = 50000-60000 K and N/O close to the solar value at all O/H. We critically assess the applicability of commonly-used strong line indices for estimating gas-phase metallicities, and consider the implications of the small intrinsic scatter in the empirical relationship between excitation-sensitive line indices and stellar mass (i.e., the "mass-metallicity" relation), at z$\sim$2.3.},

abstract = {Type II SNe can trace star formation to probe its global metallicity distribution at low-redshift. We present oxygen and iron abundance distributions of SN II progenitor regions that avoid many previous sources of bias. Because Fe (rather than O) abundance drives the late stage evolution of the massive stars that are the progenitors of CCSNe, and because Fe enrichment lags O enrichment, we find a general conversion from O abundance to Fe abundance. The distributions we present here are the best yet standard of comparison for evaluating how rare classes of SNe depend on progenitor metallicity. We measure the gas-phase O abundance of a representative subsample of the hosts of SNe II from the first-year PTF SN search, using a combination of SDSS spectra near the SN location (9) and new long slit spectroscopy (25). The median metallicity of these 34 hosts is 12+log(O/H) = 8.65, with a median error of 0.09. The median host galaxy stellar mass from fits to SDSS photometry is 10^9.9 solar masses. They do not show a systematic offset in metallicity or mass from a redshift-matched sample of the MPA/JHU value-added catalog. In contrast to previous SN host metallicity studies, this sample is drawn from a single, areal survey. SNe in the lowest-mass galaxies are not systematically excluded. The metallicity distribution we find is statistically indistinguishable from the metallicity distribution of SN II hosts found by targeted surveys and by samples from multiple surveys with different selection functions. Using the relationship between Fe and O abundances found for Milky Way disk, bulge, and halo stars, we translate our O abundance distribution of SN II environments into Fe abundance estimates. We find that though this sample spans only 0.65 dex in O abundance, the gap between the Fe and O abundance is 50% wider at the low-metallicity end of our sample than at the high-metallicity end.

abstract = {Prochter and coworkers recently found that the number density of strong intervening 0.5<z<2 Mg II absorbers detected in gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow spectra is nearly 4 times larger than those in QSO spectra. We have conducted a similar study using C IV absorbers. Our C IV sample, consisting of a total of 19 systems, is drawn from three high-resolution and high to moderate signal-to-noise ratio VLT UVES spectra of three long-duration GRB afterglows, covering the redshift interval 1.6<z<3.1. The column density distribution and number density of this sample do not show any statistical difference from the same quantities measured in QSO spectra. We discuss several possibilities for the discrepancy between C IV and Mg II absorbers and conclude that a higher dust extinction in the Mg II QSO samples studied up to now would give the most straightforward solution. However, this effect is only important for the strong Mg II absorbers. Regardless of the reasons for this discrepancy, this result confirms once more that GRBs can be used to detect a side of the universe that was unknown before, not necessarily connected with GRBs themselves, providing an alternative and fundamental investigative tool of the cosmic evolution of the universe.},

abstract = {Precision cosmology with Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) makes use of the fact that SN Ia luminosities depend on their light-curve shapes and colours. Using Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) and other data, we show that there is an additional dependence on the global characteristics of their host galaxies: events of the same light-curve shape and colour are, on average, 0.08 mag (4.0$\sigma$) brighter in massive host galaxies (presumably metal-rich) and galaxies with low specific star formation rates (sSFR). These trends do not depend on any assumed cosmological model, and are independent of the SN light-curve width: both fast and slow-declining events show the same trends. SNe Ia in galaxies with a low sSFR also have a smaller slope ('$\beta$') between their luminosities and colours with ∼2.7$\sigma$ significance, and a smaller scatter on SN Ia Hubble diagrams (at 95 per cent confidence), though the significance of these effects is dependent on the reddest SNe. SN Ia colours are similar between low-mass and high-mass hosts, leading us to interpret their luminosity differences as an intrinsic property of the SNe and not of some external factor such as dust. If the host stellar mass is interpreted as a metallicity indicator using galaxy mass-metallicity relations, the luminosity trends are in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions. We show that the average stellar mass, and therefore the average metallicity, of our SN Ia host galaxies decreases with redshift. The SN Ia luminosity differences consequently introduce a systematic error in cosmological analyses,},

We use public imaging surveys to gather multi-wavelength photometry for all CCSN host galaxies and fit their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to derive stellar masses and integrated star formation rates. CCSNe populate galaxies across a wide range of stellar masses, from blue and compact dwarf galaxies to large spiral galaxies. We find 40(+6,-5) per cent of CCSNe are in dwarf galaxies (M < 10^9 M_Sun) and 2(+3,-1) per cent are in dwarf starburst galaxies (sSFR > 10^-8 yr^-1). We reanalyse the low-redshift SLSN and LGRB hosts from the literature (out to z < 0.3) in a homogeneous way and compare against the CCSN host sample. We find that the relative SLSN to CCSN supernova rate is increased in low-mass galaxies and at high specific star-formation rates. These parameters are strongly covariant and we cannot break the degeneracy between them with our current sample. Larger unbiased samples of CCSNe from projects such as ZTF and LSST will be needed to determine whether host-galaxy mass (a proxy for metallicity) or specific star-formation rate (a proxy for star-formation intensity and potential IMF variation) is more fundamental in driving the preference for SLSNe and LGRBs in unusual galaxy environments.},

abstract = {Rapidly evolving transients form a new class of transients which show shorter timescales of the light curves than those of typical core-collapse and thermonuclear supernovae. We performed a systematic search for rapidly evolving transients using the deep data taken with the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program Transient Survey. By measuring the timescales of the light curves of 1824 transients, we identified 5 rapidly evolving transients. Our samples are found in a wide range of redshifts (0.3 $\le$ z $\le$ 1.5) and peak absolute magnitudes ($-$17 $\ge$ $M_i$ $\ge$ $-$20). The properties of the light curves are similar to those of the previously discovered rapidly evolving transients. They show a relatively blue spectral energy distribution, with the best-fit blackbody of 8,000 - 18,000 K. We show that some of the transients require power sources other than the radioactive decays of $^{56}$Ni because of their high peak luminosities and short timescales. The host galaxies of all the samples are star-forming galaxies, suggesting a massive star origin for the rapidly evolving transients. The event rate is roughly estimated to be $\sim$4,000 events yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$, which is about 1 $\%$ of core-collapse supernovae.},

abstract = {Two-thirds of long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) show soft X-ray absorption in excess of the Milky Way. The column densities of metals inferred from UV and optical spectra differ from those derived from soft X-ray spectra, at times by an order of magnitude, with the latter being higher. The origin of the soft X-ray absorption excess observed in GRB X-ray afterglow spectra remains a heavily debated issue, which has resulted in numerous investigations on the effect of hot material both internal and external to the GRB host galaxy on our X-ray afterglow observations. Nevertheless, all models proposed so far have either only been able to account for a subset of our observations (i.e. at z > 2), or they have required fairly extreme conditions to be present within the absorbing material. In this paper, we investigate the absorption of the GRB afterglow by a collisionally ionised and turbulent interstellar medium (ISM). We find that a dense (3 cm −3) collisionally ionised ISM could produce UV/optical and soft X-ray absorbing column densities that differ by a factor of 10. However the UV/optical and soft X-ray absorbing column densities for such sightlines are 2−3 orders of magnitude lower in comparison to the GRB afterglow spectra. For those GRBs with a larger soft X-ray excess by up to an order of magnitude, the contribution in absorption from a turbulent ISM as considered here would ease the required conditions of additional absorbing components, such as the GRB circumburst medium and intergalactic medium.},

abstract = {Long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) accompany the deaths of some massive stars and hence, since massive stars are short lived, are a tracer of star formation activity. Given that GRBs are bright enough to be seen to very high redshifts, and detected even in dusty environments, they should therefore provide a powerful probe of the global star formation history of the universe. The potential of this approach can be investigated via submm photometry of GRB host galaxies. Submm luminosity also correlates with star formation rate, so the distribution of host galaxy submm fluxes should allow us to test the two methods for consistency. Here, we report new JCMT/SCUBA 850 micron measurements for 15 GRB hosts. Combining these data with results from previous studies we construct a sample of 21 hosts with <1.4 mJy errors. We show that the distribution of apparent 850 micron flux densities of this sample is reasonably consistent with model predictions, but there is tentative evidence of a dearth of submm bright (>4 mJy) galaxies. Furthermore, the optical/infrared properties of the submm brightest GRB hosts are not typical of the galaxy population selected in submm surveys, although the sample size is still small. Possible selection effects and physical mechanisms which may explain these discrepancies are discussed.},

abstract = {We present a study of the composition of gas and dust in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC, together -- the MCs) as measured by UV absorption spectroscopy. We have measured P II and Fe II along 85 sightlines toward the MCs using archival FUSE observations. For 16 of those sightlines, we have measured Si II, Cr II, and Zn II from new HST COS observations. We have combined these measurements with H I and H$_2$ column densities and reference stellar abundances from the literature to derive gas-phase abundances, depletions, and gas-to-dust ratios (GDRs). 80 of our 84 P measurements and 13 of our 16 Zn measurements are depleted by more than 0.1 decades, suggesting that P and Zn abundances are not accurate metallicity indicators at and above the metallicity of the SMC. The maximum P and Zn depletions are the same in the MW, LMC, and SMC. Si, Cr, and Fe are systematically less depleted in the SMC than in the MW or LMC. The minimum Si depletion in the SMC is consistent with zero. Our depletion-derived GDRs broadly agree with GDRs from the literature. The GDR varies from location to location within a galaxy by a factor of up to 2 in the LMC and up to 5 in the SMC. This variation is evidence of dust destruction and/or growth in the diffuse neutral phase of the interstellar medium.},

abstract = {The precise localization of the repeating fast radio burst (FRB 121102) has provided the first unambiguous association (chance coincidence probability $p\lesssim3\times10^{-4}$) of an FRB with an optical and persistent radio counterpart. We report on optical imaging and spectroscopy of the counterpart and find that it is an extended ($0.6^{\prime\prime}-0.8^{\prime\prime}$) object displaying prominent Balmer and [OIII] emission lines. Based on the spectrum and emission line ratios, we classify the counterpart as a low-metallicity, star-forming, $m_{r^\prime} = 25.1$ AB mag dwarf galaxy at a redshift of $z=0.19273(8)$, corresponding to a luminosity distance of 972 Mpc. From the angular size, the redshift, and luminosity, we estimate the host galaxy to have a diameter $\lesssim4$ kpc and a stellar mass of $M_*\sim4-7\times 10^{7}\,M_\odot$, assuming a mass-to-light ratio between 2 to 3$\,M_\odot\,L_\odot^{-1}$. Based on the H$\alpha$ flux, we estimate the star formation rate of the host to be $0.4\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ and a substantial host dispersion measure depth $\lesssim 324\,\mathrm{pc\,cm^{-3}}$. The net dispersion measure contribution of the host galaxy to FRB 121102 is likely to be lower than this value depending on geometrical factors. We show that the persistent radio source at FRB 121102's location reported by Marcote et al (2017) is offset from the galaxy's center of light by $\sim$200 mas and the host galaxy does not show optical signatures for AGN activity. If FRB 121102 is typical of the wider FRB population and if future interferometric localizations preferentially find them in dwarf galaxies with low metallicities and prominent emission lines, they would share such a preference with long gamma ray bursts and superluminous supernovae.},

We reobserved the galaxy in high spatial resolution using the VIMOS integral-field unit at the VLT with a spaxel size of 0.67 arcsec. Furthermore, we use long-slit high-resolution data from HIRES/Keck at two different slit positions covering the GRB site, the centre of the galaxy and an H II region next to the GRB region. We compare the properties of different H II regions in the galaxy with the GRB site and study the global and local kinematic properties of this galaxy. The resolved data show that the GRB site has the lowest metallicity in the galaxy with ∼1/3 Z , but its specific star formation rate (SSFR) of 7.4 M yr −1 /L/L* and age (determined},

abstract = {Abundances of galaxies at redshifts z > 4 are difficult to obtain from damped Ly$\alpha$ (DLA) systems in the sightlines of quasars (QSOs) due to the Ly$\alpha$ forest blanketing and the low number of high-redshift QSOs known to date. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with their higher luminosity are well suited to study galaxies out to the formation of the first stars at z > 10. The large wavelength coverage of the X-shooter spectrograph makes it an excellent tool to study the interstellar medium of high-redshift galaxies, in particular if the redshift is not known beforehand. In this paper, we determine the properties of a GRB host at z = 4.667 23 from absorption lines combined with X-ray and optical imaging data. This is one of the highest redshifts where a detailed analysis with medium-resolution data is possible. We measure a relatively high metallicity of [S/H] = -1.1 ± 0.2 for a galaxy at this redshift. Assuming ultraviolet pumping as origin for the fine-structure lines, the material observed is between 0.3 and 1.0 kpc from the GRB. The extinction determined by the spectral slope from X-rays to the infrared shows a moderate value of AV = 0.13 ± 0.05 mag and relative abundances point to a warm disc extinction pattern. Low- and high-ionization as well as fine-structure lines show a complicated kinematic structure probably pointing to a merger in progress. We also detect one intervening system at z = 2.18. GRB-DLAs have a shallower evolution of metallicity with redshift than QSO absorbers and no evolution in their H i column density or ionization fraction. GRB hosts at high redshifts seem to continue the trend of the metallicity-luminosity relation towards lower metallicities but the sample is still too small to draw a definite conclusion. While the detection of GRBs at z > 4 with current satellites is still difficult, they are very important for our understanding of the early epochs of star and galaxy formation.},

abstract = {We extend the analysis presented in Tran (2001) of a spectropolarimetric survey of the CfA and 12micron samples of Seyfert 2 galaxies (S2s). We confirm that S2s with hidden broad line regions (HBLRs) tend to have hotter circumnuclear dust temperatures, show mid-IR spectra more characteristic of S1 galaxies, and are intrinsically more luminous than non-HBLR S2s. The level of obscuration and circumnuclear star formation, however, appear to be similar between HBLR and non-HBLR S2 galaxies, based on an examination of various observational indicators. HBLR S2s, on average, share many similar large-scale, presumably isotropic, characteristics with Seyfert 1 galaxies (S1s), as would be expected if the unified model is correct, while non-HBLR S2s generally do not. The active nuclear engines of non-HBLR S2s then, appear to be truly weaker than HBLR S2s, which in turn, are fully consistent with being S1s viewed from another direction. There is also evidence that the fraction of detected HBLR increases with radio power of the AGN. Thus, not all Seyfert 2 galaxies may be intrinsically similar in nature, and we speculate that evolutionary processes may be at work.},

abstract = {In this third paper of the series we present our interpretation for the rise in the degree of polarization across the broad wings of Hbeta and Halpha compared with the nonstellar continuum that is observed in all galaxies in our sample but NGC 1068 (Paper II). The similarity of polarization angles between the broad-line wings and adjacent continuum, and their perpendicular relationship with the radio and/or extended emission structure axis strongly suggest that the obscuring torus picture with the general scattering geometry proposed for NGC 1068 is basically correct. If so, the observed polarizations can be explained by the hypothesis that, in addition to the scattered (hence polarized) continuum radiation from the obscured nucleus, there exists a substantial unpolarized continuum underlying and accounting for ˜60%-90% of the total featureless continua of these Seyfert 2 galaxies. The continuum polarizations after the removal of this diluting component are generally very high (≳15%), and in good accord with those expected from the obscuring torus/scattering electron models. Available evidence also suggests that this unpolarized continuum may represent the optically thin thermal radiation from the scattering region itself. Polarized broad lines appear to be found predominately in multiple perhaps interacting systems of galaxies. Barring strong selection effects, this may indicate that perturbing or merging processes play an important role in the existence and/or detection of hidden broad-line regions in Seyfert 2 galaxies at some stages of their evolution.},

We find a tight (AE0.1 dex) correlation between stellar mass and metallicity spanning over 3 orders of magnitude in stellar mass and a factor of 10 in metallicity. The relation is relatively steep from 10 8.5 to 10 10.5 M h {\`{A}}2 70 , in good accord with known trends between luminosity and metallicity, but flattens above 10 10.5 M .

We show that metal loss is strongly anticorrelated with baryonic mass, with low-mass dwarf galaxies being 5 times more metal depleted than L {\~{A}} galaxies at z $ 0:1. Evidence for metal depletion is not confined to dwarf galaxies but is found in galaxies with masses as high as 10 10 M .

abstract = {Measuring the star formation rate (SFR) at high redshift is crucial for understanding cosmic reionization and galaxy formation. Two common complementary approaches are Lyman-Break-Galaxy (LBG) surveys for large samples and Gamma-Ray-Burst (GRB) observations for sensitivity to SFR in small galaxies. The z>4 GRB-inferred SFR is higher than the LBG rate, but this difference is difficult to understand, as both methods rely on several modeling assumptions. Using a physically motivated galaxy luminosity function model, with star formation in dark-matter halos with virial temperature Tvir>2e4 K (M_DM>2e8 M_sun), we show that GRB and LBG-derived SFRs are consistent if GRBs extend to faint galaxies (M_AB<-11). To test star formation below the detection limit L_lim$\sim$0.05L^*_{z=3} of LBG surveys, we propose to measure the fraction f_det(L>L_lim,z) of GRB hosts with L>L_lim. This fraction quantifies the missing star formation fraction in LBG surveys, constraining the mass-suppression scale for galaxy formation, with weak dependence on modeling assumptions. Because f_det(L>L_lim,z) corresponds to the ratio of star formation rates derived from LBG and GRB surveys, if these estimators are unbiased, measuring f_det(L>L_lim,z) also constrains the redshift evolution of the GRB production rate per unit mass of star formation. Our analysis predicts significant success for GRB host detections at z$\sim$5 with f_det(L>L_lim,z)$\sim$0.4, but rarer detections at z>6. By analyzing the upper limits on host-galaxy luminosities of six z>5 GRBs from literature data, we infer that galaxies with M_AB>-15 were present at z>5 at 95% confidence, demonstrating the key role played by very faint galaxies during reionization.},

The reduced chi (2) found is much lower than can be expected. All of the intrinsic dispersion is thereby removed from the data sample, leaving perfectly standardized candles insofar as one can measure with present techniques. The best-fit solution has a mysteriously low value for R (referred to the B-band) of about 2 and a value of b $\sim$ 0.5 which is smaller than previously reported without the color correction. These parameters lead, using pre-Hipparcos distances for Cepheid calibrations, to essentially the same value for the Hubble constant. Our preliminary value, subject to further investigation of Cepheid-calibrated supernovae using this same color correction, is H{0 = 60 +/- 6 \ kms(-1) Mpc(-1}) .

We mimic the resolution, pixel size, and signal-to-noise ratio of the observations, as well as the distributions of impact parameters and galaxy redshift errors. We find that the EAGLE reference model is in excellent agreement with the observations. In particular, the simulation reproduces the high metal-line optical depths found at small galactocentric distances, the optical depth enhancements out to impact param-eters of 2 proper Mpc, and the prominent redshift-space distortions which we find are due to peculiar velocities rather than redshift errors. The agreement is best for halo masses ∼ 10 12.0 M , for which the observed and simulated stellar masses also agree most closely. We examine the median ion mass-weighted radial gas velocities around the galaxies, and find that most of the gas is infalling, with the infall velocity depending on halo rather than stellar mass. From this we conclude that the observed redshift-space distortions are predominantly caused by infall rather than outflows.},

Our spatially resolved data allow reliable modelling of individual galaxies, including the effect of pressure support on the inferred gravitational potential. At fixed circular velocity, we find higher baryonic masses and similar stellar masses at z$\sim$2.3 as compared to z$\sim$0.9. Together with the decreasing gas-to-stellar mass ratios with decreasing redshift, this implies that the contribution of dark matter to the dynamical mass at the galaxy scale increases towards lower redshift. A comparison to local relations reveals a negative evolution of the stellar and baryonic TFR zero-points from z=0 to z$\sim$0.9, no evolution of the stellar TFR zero-point from z$\sim$0.9 to z$\sim$2.3, and a positive evolution of the baryonic TFR zero-point from z$\sim$0.9 to z$\sim$2.3. We discuss a toy model of disk galaxy evolution to explain the observed, non-monotonic TFR evolution, taking into account the empirically motivated redshift dependencies of galactic gas fractions, and of the relative amount of baryons to dark matter on galaxy and halo scales.},

Our results provide confirmation with improved statistical significance that SNe Ia, after standardization, are on average more luminous in massive hosts (significance > 5$\sigma$), and decline more rapidly in massive hosts (significance > 9$\sigma$) and in hosts with low specific star formation rates (significance > 8$\sigma$). We study the variation of these relationships with redshift and detect no evolution. We split SNe Ia into pairs of subsets that are based on the properties of the hosts, and fit cosmological models to each subset. Including both systematic and statistical uncertainties, we do not find any significant shift in the best-fit cosmological parameters between the subsets.

abstract = {We propose a wind-driven model for peculiar transients, and apply the model to AT2018cow and iPTF14hls. In the wind-driven model, we assume that a continuous outflow like a stellar wind is injected from a central system. While these transients have different observational properties, this unified model can explain their photometric properties which are not reproduced by a supernova-like instantaneous explosion. Furthermore, the model predicts characteristic spectral features and evolution, which are well in line with those of AT2018cow and iPTF14hls. Despite the different observational properties, the wind model shows that they have some common features; the large mass-loss rates (up to $\sim 20M_{\odot}{\rm \simyr^{-1}}$ for AT2018cow and $\sim 30M_{\odot}{\rm \simyr^{-1}}$ for iPTF14hls), the characteristic radii of $\sim 10^{13}{\rm \simcm}$ for the launch of the wind, and the kinetic energies of $\sim 10^{51}{\rm \simerg}$. It would indicate that both may be related to events involving a red super giant (RSG), in which the RSG envelope is rapidly ejected by an event at a stellar core scale. On the other hand, the main differences are time scales and the total ejected mass. We then suggests that iPTF14hls may represent a dynamical common-envelope evolution induced by massive binary systems ($\sim 50M_{\odot}$ each). AT2018cow may be either a tidal disruption event of a low-mass RSG by a black hole (BH), or a BH-forming failed supernova.},

abstract = {We study the properties of gas inside and around galaxy haloes as a function of radius and halo mass, focussing mostly on z=2, but also showing some results for z=0. For this purpose, we use a suite of large cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations from the OverWhelmingly Large Simulations project. The properties of cold- and hot-mode gas, which we separate depending on whether the temperature has been higher than 10^5.5 K while it was extragalactic, are clearly distinguishable in the outer parts of massive haloes (virial temperatures >> 10^5 K. The differences between cold- and hot-mode gas resemble those between inflowing and outflowing gas. The cold-mode gas is mostly confined to clumpy filaments that are approximately in pressure equilibrium with the diffuse, hot-mode gas. Besides being colder and denser, cold-mode gas typically has a much lower metallicity and is much more likely to be infalling. However, the spread in the properties of the gas is large, even for a given mode and a fixed radius and halo mass, which makes it impossible to make strong statements about individual gas clouds. Metal-line cooling causes a strong cooling flow near the central galaxy, which makes it hard to distinguish gas accreted through the cold and hot modes in the inner halo. Stronger feedback results in larger outflow velocities and pushes hot-mode gas to larger radii. The gas properties evolve as expected from virial arguments, which can also account for the dependence of many gas properties on halo mass. We argue that cold streams penetrating hot haloes are observable as high-column density HI Lyman-alpha absorption systems in sightlines near massive foreground galaxies.},

abstract = {We present synthetic spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for single-age, single-metallicity stellar populations (SSPs) covering the full optical spectral range at moderately high resolution [full width at half-maximum (FWHM) = 2.3 {\AA}]. These SEDs constitute our base models, as they combine scaled-solar isochrones with an empirical stellar spectral library [Medium resolution INT Library of Empirical Spectra (MILES)], which follows the chemical evolution pattern of the solar neighbourhood. The models rely as much as possible on empirical ingredients, not just on the stellar spectra, but also on extensive photometric libraries, which are used to determine the transformations from the theoretical parameters of the isochrones to observational quantities. The unprecedented stellar parameter coverage of the MILES stellar library allowed us to safely extend our optical SSP SED predictions from intermediate- to very-old-age regimes and the metallicity coverage of the SSPs from super-solar to [M/H] = -2.3. SSPs with such low metallicities are particularly useful for globular cluster studies. We have computed SSP SEDs for a suite of initial mass function shapes and slopes. We provide a quantitative analysis of the dependence of the synthesized SSP SEDs on the (in)complete coverage of the stellar parameter space in the input library that not only shows that our models are of higher quality than those of other works, but also in which range of SSP parameters our models are reliable. The SSP SEDs are a useful tool to perform the analysis of stellar populations in a very flexible manner. Observed spectra can be studied by means of full spectrum fitting or by using line indices. For the latter, we propose a new line index system to avoid the intrinsic uncertainties associated with the popular Lick/IDS system and provide more appropriate, uniform, spectral resolution. Apart from constant resolution as a function of wavelength, the system is also based on flux-calibrated spectra. Data can be analysed at three different resolutions: 5, 8.4 and 14 {\AA} (FWHM), which are appropriate for studying globular cluster, low- and intermediate-mass galaxies, and massive galaxies, respectively. Furthermore, we provide polynomials to transform current Lick/IDS line index measurements to the new system. We provide line index tables in the new system for various popular samples of Galactic globular clusters and galaxies. We apply the models to various stellar clusters and galaxies with high-quality spectra, for which independent studies are available, obtaining excellent results. Finally, we designed a web page from which not only these models and stellar libraries can be downloaded but which also provides a suite of on-line tools to facilitate the handling and transformation of the spectra. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

abstract = {Feedback from star formation is thought to play a key role in the formation and evolution of galaxies, but its implementation in cosmological simulations is currently hampered by a lack of numerical resolution. We present and test a sub-grid recipe to model feedback from massive stars in cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. The energy is distributed in kinetic form among the gas particles surrounding recently formed stars. The impact of the feedback is studied using a suite of high-resolution simulations of isolated disc galaxies embedded in dark halos with total mass 10^{10} and 10^{12} Msol/h. We focus in particular on the effect of pressure forces on wind particles within the disc, which we turn off temporarily in some of our runs to mimic a recipe that has been widely used in the literature. We find that this popular recipe gives dramatically different results because (ram) pressure forces on expanding superbubbles determine both the structure of the disc and the development of large-scale outflows. Pressure forces exerted by expanding superbubbles puff up the disc, giving the dwarf galaxy an irregular morphology and creating a galactic fountain in the massive galaxy. Hydrodynamic drag within the disc results in a strong increase of the effective mass loading of the wind for the dwarf galaxy, but quenches much of the outflow in the case of the high-mass galaxy.},

abstract = {Aims. We investigate the existence of a metallicity threshold for the production of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs). Methods. We used the host galaxies of the Swift/BAT6 sample of LGRBs. We considered the stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and metallicity determined from the host galaxy photometry and spectroscopy up to z = 2 and used them to compare the distribution of host galaxies to that of field galaxies in the mass-metallicity and fundamental metallicity relation plane. Results. We find that although LGRBs also form in galaxies with relatively large stellar masses, the large majority of host galax-ies have metallicities below log(O/H) ∼ 8.6. The extension to z = 2 results in a good sampling of stellar masses also above Log(M * /M) ∼ 9.5 and provides evidence that LGRB host galaxies do not follow the fundamental metallicity relation. As shown by the comparison with dedicated numerical simulations of LGRB host galaxy population, these results are naturally explained by the existence of a mild (∼ 0.7 Z) threshold for the LGRB formation. The present statistics does not allow us to discriminate between different shapes of the metallicity cutoff, but the relatively high metallicity threshold found in this work is somewhat in disagreement to most of the standard single-star models for LGRB progenitors.},

abstract = {Aims. Long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) are associated with massive stars and are therefore linked to star formation. However, the conditions needed for the progenitor stars to produce LGRBs can affect the relation between the LGRB rate and star formation. By using the power of a complete LGRB sample, our long-term aim is to understand whether such a bias exists and, if it does, what its origin is. Methods. To reach our goal we use the Swift/BAT6 complete sample of LGRBs. In this first paper, we build the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the 14 z < 1 host galaxies of the BAT6 LGRB sample and determine their stellar masses (M<inf>Black star</inf>) from SED fitting. To investigate the presence of a bias in the LGRB-star formation relation we compare the stellar mass distribution of the LGRB host galaxies (i) with star-forming galaxies observed in deep surveys (UltraVISTA) within the same redshift limit; (ii) with semi-analytical models of the z < 1 star-forming galaxy population; and (iii) with dedicated numerical simulations of LGRB hosts having different metallicity thresholds for the progenitor star environment. Results. We find that at z < 1, LGRBs tend to avoid massive galaxies and are very powerful for selecting a population of faint low-mass star-forming galaxies, partly below the completeness limits of galaxy surveys. The stellar mass distribution of the hosts is not consistent with that of the UltraVISTA star-forming galaxies weighted by their star formation rate (SFR). This implies that, at least at z < 1, LGRBs are not unbiased tracers of star formation. To make the two distributions consistent, a much steeper faint end of the mass function would be required or a very shallow SFR-mass relation for the low-mass galaxy population. The comparison with the GRB host galaxy simulations indicates that, to reproduce the stellar mass distribution, a metallicity threshold of the order of Z<inf>th</inf> = 0.3-0.5 Z<inf>⊙</inf> is necessary to form a LGRB. Models without a metallicity threshold or with an extreme threshold of Z<inf>th</inf> = 0.1 Z<inf>⊙</inf> are excluded at z < 1. Under a very basic assumption, we estimate that the LGRB rate can directly trace the SFR starting from z ∼ 4 and above. Conclusions. GRB hosts at z < 1 have lower luminosities and stellar masses than expected if LGRBs were unbiased star formation tracers. The use of the Swift/BAT6 complete sample keeps this result from being affected by possible biases that could have influenced past results based on incomplete samples. The preference for low metallicities (Z ≲ 0.5 Z<inf>⊙</inf>) inferred by the comparison with the simulations can be a consequence of the particular conditions needed for the progenitor star to produce a GRB.},

abstract = {Using MUSE on the ESO-VLT, we obtained a 4 hour exposure of the z=3.12 radio galaxy MRC0316-257. We detect features down to $\sim$10^-19 erg/s/cm^2/arcsec^2 with the highest surface brightness regions reaching more than a factor of 100 higher. We find Ly-alpha emission out to $\sim$250 kpc in projection from the active galactic nucleus (AGN). The emission shows arc-like morphologies arising at 150-250 kpc from the nucleus in projection with the connected filamentary structures reaching down into the circum-nuclear region. The most distant arc is offset by 700 km/s relative to circum-nuclear HeII 1640 emission, which we assume to be at the systemic velocity. As we probe emission closer to the nucleus, the filamentary emission narrows in projection on the sky, the relative velocity decreases to $\sim$250 km/s, and line full-width at half maximum range from 300-700 km/s. From UV line ratios, the emission on scales of 10s of kpc from the nucleus along a wide angle in the direction of the radio jets is clearly excited by the radio jets and ionizing radiation of the AGN. Assuming ionization equilibrium, the more extended emission outside of the axis of the jet direction would require 100% or more illumination to explain the observed surface brightness. High speed (>300 km/s) shocks into rare gas would provide sufficiently high surface brightness. We discuss the possibility that the arcs of Ly-alpha emission represent accretion shocks and the filamentary emission represent gas flows into the halo, and compare our results with gas accretion simulations.},

abstract = {We present a study of the early build-up of dust in high redshift galaxies. The study is based on the analysis of 38 Damped Lyalpha systems (DLAs) for which we derive the fraction of iron atoms in dust form, f(Fe). The sample is representative of metal-poor galaxies in the redshift range 0.6 less than or equal to z less than or equal to 3.4 selected on the basis of their absorption H I column density (N(HI) greater than or equal to2 x 10(20) atoms cm(-2)). We find that the dust fraction increases with metallicity, from f(Fe) similar or equal to 0 at [Fe/H] similar to -2 dex, up to f(Fe) similar or equal to 0.9 at solar metallicity; the increase is fast below [Fe/H] similar or equal to -1 dex and mild at higher metallicities. We also find some evidence for an increase of f(Fe) with cosmic time; a large fraction of the systems younger than approximate to3 Gyr has f(Fe) less than or similar to 0.5. These results indicate that the dust-to-metal ratio increases in the course of chemical evolution, at variance with the hypothesis of an approximately constant dust-to-metal ratio, commonly adopted in models of galactic evolution. This hypothesis is consistent with local and high-redshift data only when the metallicity is relatively high ([Fe/H] greater than or similar to -1 dex). The results of this work suggest that the main mechanisms of dust formation may be rather sensitive to the level of metallicity attained by a galaxy in the course of its chemical evolution. A metallicity-dependent dust production by SNe II seems to be the most promising mechanism to explain the rise of f(Fe) at [Fe/H] less than or similar to -1 dex},

abstract = {Silicates are an important component of interstellar dust that has been poorly investigated in high redshift galaxies. As a preliminary step to studying silicates at high redshift, we survey silicon depletions in damped Ly $\alpha$ (DLA) systems. Silicon depletion is mild in the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM) and is expected to be weaker in most DLA systems, so we introduce a method for improving the accuracy of DLA depletion measurements. We compare abundance ratios measured in the gas with calculations of total abundance ratios of gas and dust predicted by models of galactic chemical evolution tailored for DLA systems. To tune the model parameters, we use the dust-free observational diagram S/Zn versus Zn/H, and we also compare the look back time estimated from the absorption redshift with the evolutionary time predicted by the model. By applying our method to a large set of DLA column densities, we succeeded in measuring the depletion of silicon in 74 systems. For comparison, we also measure iron and magnesium depletions (105 and 10 systems, respectively) with the same method. The mean depletion of silicon that we derive, $\delta$ Si −0.27 ± 0.16 dex, is surprisingly close to that of iron, $\delta$ Fe −0.42 ± 0.28 dex, despite iron being much more depleted than silicon in the Galactic ISM. Silicon depletion in DLA systems does not correlate with metallicity, at variance with iron depletion, for which we confirm a rise with [Fe/H] found in previous work. Magnesium depletion seems to behave more in accordance with silicon than with iron. The different behaviors of the silicon and iron depletions suggests a complex history of dust production at the early stages of galactic chemical evolution.},

abstract = {We used the photometric database of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to estimate the reddening of 13 SDSS quasars selected on the basis of the presence of zinc absorption lines in an intervening Damped Ly alpha (DLA) system. In 5 of these quasars the reddening is detected at $\sim$2 sigma confidence level in two independent color indices of the SDSS ugriz photometric system. A detailed analysis of the data supports an origin of the reddening in the intervening absorbers. We used these rare measurements of extinction in DLA systems to probe the relation between extinction and metal column density in the interval of absorption redshift 0.7 </$\sim$ z </$\sim$ 2.0. We find that the mean extinction in the V band per atom of iron in the dust is remarkably similar to that found in interstellar clouds of the Milky Way. This result lends support to previous estimates of the dust obscuration effect in DLA systems based on a Milky Way extinction/metal column density relation. We propose a simple mechanism, based on dust grain destruction/accretion properties, which may explain the approximate constancy of the extinction per atom of iron in the dust.},

abstract = {We present photometry and spectroscopy of the afterglow of GRB 030323. VET spectra of the afterglow show damped Lyalpha (DLA) absorption and low- and high-ionization lines at a redshift z = 3.3718 +/- 0.0005. The inferred neutral hydrogen column density, log N(H I) = 21.90 +/- 0.07, is larger than any (GRB- or QSO-) DLA H I column density inferred directly from Lyalpha in absorption, From the afterglow photometry, we derive a conservative upper limit to the host-galaxy extinction: A(V) < 0.5 mag. The iron abundance is [Fe/H] = -1.47 &PLUSMN; 0.11, while the rnetallicity of the gas as measured from sulphur is [S/H] = -1.26 &PLUSMN; 0.20. We derive an upper limit on the H-2 molecular fraction of 2N(H-2)/(2N(H-2) + N(H I)) &LSIM; 10(-6). In the Ly&alpha; trough, a Ly&alpha; emission line is detected, which corresponds to a star-formation rate (not corrected for dust extinction) of roughly I M. yr(-1). All these results are consistent with the host galaxy of GRB 030323 consisting of a low metallicity gas with a low dust content. We detect fine-structure lines of silicon, Si II*, which have never been clearly detected in QSO-DLAs; this Suggests that these lines are produced in the vicinity of the GRB explosion site. Under the assumption that these fine-structure levels are Populated by particle collisions, we estimate the H I volume density to be n(H I) = 10(2)-10(4) cm(-3). HST/ACS imaging 4 months after the burst shows an extended AB(F606W) = 28.0 &PLUSMN; 0.3 mag object at a distance of 0.&DPRIME;14 (1 kpc) from the early afterglow location, which presumably is the host galaxy of GRB 030323.},

abstract = {We present high-resolution spectroscopic observations of GRB 060418, obtained with VLT/UVES. These observations were triggered using the VLT Rapid-Response Mode (RRM), which allows for automated observations of transient phenomena, without any human intervention. This resulted in the first UVES exposure of GRB 060418 to be started only 10 min after the initial Swift satellite trigger. A sequence of spectra covering 330−670 nm were acquired at 11, 16, 25, 41 and 71 minutes (mid-exposure) after the trigger, with a resolving power of 7 km s −1 , and a signal-to-noise ratio of 10−15. This time-series clearly shows evidence for time variability of allowed transitions involving Fe II fine-structure levels (6 D 7/2 , 6 D 5/2 , 6 D 3/2 , and 6 D 1/2), and metastable levels of both Fe II (4 F 9/2 and 4 D 7/2) and Ni II (4 F 9/2), at the host-galaxy redshift z = 1.490. This is the first report of absorption lines arising from metastable levels of Fe II and Ni II along any GRB sightline. We model the observed evolution of the level populations with three different excitation mechanisms: collisions, excitation by infra-red photons, and fluorescence following excitation by ultraviolet photons. Our data allow us to reject the collisional and IR excitation scenarios with high confidence. The UV pumping model, in which the GRB afterglow UV photons excite a cloud of atoms with a column density N, distance d, and Doppler broadening parameter b, provides an excellent fit, with best-fit values: log N(Fe II) = 14.75 +0.06 −0.04 , log N(Ni II) = 13.84 ± 0.02, d = 1.7 ± 0.2 kpc, and b = 25 ± 3 km s −1 . The success of our UV pumping modeling implies that no significant amount of Fe II or Ni II is present at distances smaller than ∼1.7 kpc, most likely because it is ionized by the GRB X-ray/UV flash. Because neutral hydrogen is more easily ionized than Fe II and Ni II, this minimum distance also applies to any H I present. Therefore the majority of very large H I column densities typically observed along GRB sightlines may not be located in the immediate environment of the GRB. The UV pumping fit also constrains two GRB afterglow parameters: the spectral slope, $\beta$ = −0.5 +0.8 −1.0 , and the total rest-frame UV flux that irradiated the cloud since the GRB trigger, constraining the magnitude of a possible UV flash.},

abstract = {We model the time-variable absorption of Feii, Feiii, Siii, Cii and Crii detected in Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES) spectra of gamma-ray burst (GRB) 080310, with the afterglow radiation exciting and ionizing the interstellar medium in the host galaxy at a redshift of z = 2.42743. To estimate the rest-frame afterglow brightness as a function of time, we use a combination of the optical VRI photometry obtained by the RAPTOR-T telescope array, which is presented in this paper, and Swift's X-Ray Telescope (XRT) observations. Excitation alone, which has been successfully applied for a handful of other GRBs, fails to describe the observed column density evolution in the case of GRB080310. Inclusion of ionization is required to explain the column density decrease of all observed Feii levels (including the ground state 6D9/2) and increase of the Feiii 7S3 level. The large population of ions in this latter level (up to 10% of all Feiii) can only be explained through ionization of Feii, as a large fraction of the ionized Feii ions (we calculate 31% using the Flexible Atomic and Cowan codes) initially populate the 7S3 level of Feiii rather than the ground state. This channel for producing a significant Feiii 7S3 level population may be relevant for other objects in which absorption lines from this level, the UV34 triplet, are observed, such as broad absorption line (BAL) quasars and $\eta$ Carinae. This provides conclusive evidence for time-variable ionization in the circumburst medium, which to date has not been convincingly detected. However, the best-fit distance of the neutral absorbing cloud to the GRB is 200-400 pc, i.e. similar to GRB-absorber distance estimates for GRBs without any evidence for ionization. We find that the presence of time-varying ionization in GRB080310 is likely due to a combination of the super-solar iron abundance ([Fe/H] = +0.2) and the low Hi column density (log N(Hi) = 18.7) in the host of GRB080310. Finally, the modelling provides indications for the presence of an additional cloud at 10 50 pc from the GRB with log N(Hi) ∼ 19 20 before the burst, which became fully ionized by the radiation released during the first few tens of minutes after the GRB. {\textcopyright} 2012 ESO.},

abstract = {We present low-resolution VLT spectroscopy of the afterglow of the gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) 991216, 011211 and 021211. Our spectrum of GRB991216 is the only optical spectrum for this afterglow. It shows two probable absorption systems at z=0.80 and z=1.02, where the highest redshift most likely reflects the distance to the host galaxy. A third system may be detected at z=0.77. HST imaging of the field, obtained 4 months after the burst, has resulted in the detection of two amorphous regions of emission, one at the projected afterglow position, and the other 0.6" away. The spectrum shows a depression in flux in between 4000 A and 5500 A. This could be the result of a 2175 A-type extinction feature in the host of GRB991216, but at a rather red wavelength of 2360 A. If this interpretation is correct, it is the first time the extinction feature is seen in a GRB afterglow spectrum. It is centered at a wavelength similar to that of the ultra-violet (UV) bumps inferred from observations of a few UV-strong, hydrogen-poor stars in the Galaxy. All significant absorption lines (except for one) detected in the spectrum of GRB011211 are identified with lines originating in a single absorption system at z=2.142+/-0.002, the redshift of the GRB011211 host galaxy. We also detect the Lyman alpha absorption line in the host, to which we fit a neutral hydrogen column density of log N(HI)=20.4+/-0.2, which indicates that it is a damped Lyman alpha system. Using a curve-of-growth analysis, we estimate the Si, Fe and Al metallicity at the GRB011211 redshift. For GRB021211, we detect a single emission line in a spectrum obtained tens of days after the burst, which we identify as [OII] 3727 at z=1.006. The corresponding unobscured [OII] star-formation rate is 1.4 Msun/yr.},

abstract = {We present a detailed study of a molecular outflow feature in the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 253 using ALMA. We find that this feature is clearly associated with the edge of NGC 253's prominent ionized outflow, has a projected length of ∼300 pc, with a width of ∼ 50 pc and a velocity dispersion of ∼ 40 km s −1 , consistent with an ejection from the disk about 1 Myr ago. The kinematics of the molecular gas in this feature can be interpreted (albeit not uniquely) as accelerating at a rate of 1 km s −1 pc −1 . In this scenario, the gas is approaching escape velocity at the last measured point. Strikingly, bright tracers of dense molecular gas (HCN, CN, HCO + , CS) are also detected in the molecular outflow: We measure an HCN(1–0)/CO(1–0) line ratio of ∼ 1/10 in the outflow, similar to that in the central starburst region of NGC 253 and other starburst galaxies. By contrast, the HCN/CO line ratio in the NGC 253 disk is significantly lower (∼ 1/30), similar to other nearby galaxy disks. This strongly suggests that the streamer gas originates from the starburst, and that its physical state does not change significantly over timescales of ∼ 1 Myr during its entrainment in the outflow. Simple calculations indicate that radiation pressure is not the main mechanism for driving the outflow. The presence of such dense material in molecular outflows needs to be accounted for in simulations of galactic outflows.},

abstract = {The metallicity and dust-to-metals ratio of the Galaxy are fundamental parameters in understanding the interstellar medium (ISM). Currently, there is still some uncertainty surrounding these parameters. In this paper, the dust-to-metals ratio in the Galaxy is determined using the photoelectric absorption of the soft X-ray afterglows of a large sample of several hundred gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) to determine the metal column density in combination with Galactic dust maps to determine the line-of-sight dust extinction through the Galaxy in the direction of the GRB. GRB afterglows often have large extragalactic soft X-ray absorptions and therefore the GRB sample's upper-bound will define the Galactic dust-to-metals relation. Using a two-dimensional two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test, we determine this upper-bound and so derive the dust-to-metals ratio of the Galaxy. We find NH= 2.2+0.3_{-0.4×1021} cm-2AV as- assuming solar, Anders & Grevesse (1989, Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta, 53, 197), metallicity. This result is consistent with previous findings using bright X-ray sources in the Galaxy. Using the same technique but substituting the H i maps from the Leiden-Argentine-Bonn survey for the dust maps, allows us to place a limit on the metallicity in the Galaxy. We find a metallicity consistent with the Anders & Grevesse (1989) solar values often used in X-ray fitting. Based on this and previous studies, we suggest that the metallicity of a typical ISM sightline through the Galaxy is  0.25 dex higher than the current best estimate of the solar metallicity. We further show that the dust-to-gas ratio seems to be correlated with the total gas column density, and that this may be due to the metallicity gradient observed toward the Galactic centre. Based on the non-constant nature of the dust-to-gas ratio, we propose that the dust column density, at NH = 2.2 × 1021 cm-2 AV, represents a better proxy for the soft X-ray absorption column density than H i maps.},

abstract = {The optical afterglow spectrum of GRB 050401 (at z=2.8992+/-0.0004) shows the presence of a damped Ly$\alpha$ absorber (DLA), with logNHI=22.6+/-0.3. This is the highest column density ever observed in a DLA and is about 5 times larger than the strongest DLA detected so far in any QSO spectrum. From the optical spectrum, we also find a very large Zn column density, implying an abundance of [Zn/H]=-1.0+/-0.4. These large columns are supported by the early X-ray spectrum from Swift XRT, which shows a column density (in excess of Galactic) of logNH=22.21+0.06-0.08 assuming solar abundances (at z=2.9). The comparison of this X-ray column density, which is dominated by absorption due to $\alpha$-chain elements, and the H I column density derived from the Ly$\alpha$ absorption line allows us to derive a metallicity for the absorbing matter of [$\alpha$/H]=-0.4+/-0.3. The optical spectrum is reddened and can be well reproduced with a power law with SMC extinction, where AV=0.62+/-0.06. But the total optical extinction can also be constrained independent of the shape of the extinction curve: from the optical to X-ray spectral energy distribution, we find 0.5<$\sim$AV<$\sim$4.5. However, even this upper limit, independent of the shape of the extinction curve, is still well below the dust column that is inferred from the X-ray column density, i.e., AV=9.1+1.4-1.5. This discrepancy might be explained by a small dust content with high metallicity (low dust-to-metals ratio). ``Gray'' extinction cannot explain the discrepancy, since we are comparing the metallicity to a measurement of the total extinction (without reference to the reddening). Little dust with high metallicity may be produced by sublimation of dust grains or may naturally exist in systems younger than a few hundred megayears.},

abstract = {Galactic winds are a prime suspect for the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium and may have a strong influence on the chemical evolution of galaxies and the nature of QSO absorption line systems. We use a sample of 1406 galaxy spectra at z$\sim$1.4 from the DEEP2 redshift survey to show that blueshifted Mg II 2796, 2803 A absorption is ubiquitous in starforming galaxies at this epoch. This is the first detection of frequent outflowing galactic winds at z$\sim$1. The presence and depth of absorption are independent of AGN spectral signatures or galaxy morphology; major mergers are not a prerequisite for driving a galactic wind from massive galaxies. Outflows are found in coadded spectra of galaxies spanning a range of 30x in stellar mass and 10x in star formation rate (SFR), calibrated from K-band and from MIPS IR fluxes. The outflows have column densities of order N_H $\sim$ 10^20 cm^-2 and characteristic velocities of $\sim$ 300-500 km/sec, with absorption seen out to 1000 km/sec in the most massive, highest SFR galaxies. The velocities suggest that the outflowing gas can escape into the IGM and that massive galaxies can produce cosmologically and chemically significant outflows. Both the Mg II equivalent width and the outflow velocity are larger for galaxies of higher stellar mass and SFR, with V_wind $\sim$ SFR^0.3, similar to the scaling in low redshift IR-luminous galaxies. The high frequency of outflows in the star-forming galaxy population at z$\sim$1 indicates that galactic winds occur in the progenitors of massive spirals as well as those of ellipticals. The increase of outflow velocity with mass and SFR constrains theoretical models of galaxy evolution that include feedback from galactic winds, and may favor momentum-driven models for the wind physics.},

The relative gas phase abundances [X/Zn] and [X/Fe] found for the three main LMC component groups toward SN 1987A (240 km s-1 $\sim$< vo $\sim$< 300 km s-1) are similar to those found for warm, diffuse clouds in the Galactic disk.

Since the relative total abundances found for F-G supergiants and H II regions in both the LMC and the SMC are similar to those present in comparable Galactic objects (for the elements we consider), we conclude that the interstellar depletion patterns are also similar in the three galaxies, despite differences in overall metallicity and dust-to-gas ratio. We discuss some implications of these results for understanding the gas phase abundances found for damped Lyman-alpha systems, and conclude that both nucleosynthetic and depletion effects contribute to the observed abundances - to different degrees for different systems.},

The Keck LRIS and Magellan MagE data presented here are part of a survey that aims to construct a statistically sampled map of the physical state and metallicity of gaseous galaxy halos using the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We provide a detailed description of the optical data reduction and subsequent spectral analysis that allow us to derive the physical properties of this uniquely data-rich sample of galaxies. The galaxy sample is divided into 38 pre-selected L $\sim$ L*, z $\sim$ 0.2 "target" galaxies and 29 "bonus" galaxies that lie in close proximity to the QSO sightlines. We report galaxy spectroscopic redshifts accurate to +/- 30 km s-1, impact parameters, rest-frame colors, stellar masses, total star formation rates, and gas-phase interstellar medium oxygen abundances. When we compare the distribution of these galaxy characteristics to those of the general low-redshift population, we find good agreement. The L $\sim$ L* galaxies in this sample span a diverse range of color (1.0 < u-r < 3.0), stellar mass (10^9.5 < M/M_sun < 10^11.5), and SFRs (0.01 - 20 M_sun yr-1). These optical data, along with the COS UV spectroscopy, comprise the backbone of our efforts to understand how halo gas properties may correlate with their host galaxy properties, and ultimately to uncover the processes that drive gas outflow and/or are influenced by gas inflow.},

Here, we present optical and UV data and analysis of iPTF16asu, a luminous, rapidly-evolving, high velocity, stripped-envelope supernova. With a rest-frame rise-time of just 4 days and a peak absolute magnitude of $M_{\rm g}=-20.4$ mag, the light curve of iPTF16asu is faster and more luminous than previous rapid transients. The spectra of iPTF16asu show a featureless, blue continuum near peak that develops into a Type Ic-BL spectrum on the decline. We show that while the late-time light curve could plausibly be powered by $^{56}$Ni decay, the early emission requires a different energy source. Non-detections in the X-ray and radio strongly constrain any associated gamma-ray burst to be low-luminosity. We suggest that the early emission may have been powered by either a rapidly spinning-down magnetar, or by shock breakout in an extended envelope of a very energetic explosion. In either scenario a central engine is required, making iPTF16asu an intriguing transition object between superluminous supernovae, Type Ic-BL supernovae, and low-energy gamma-ray bursts.},

Through Voigt-profile fitting of absorption lines from the Lyman-series, we constrain the neutral hydrogen column density to $N_{\mathrm{HI}} \leq 10^{18.35}$ cm$^{-2}$ for the densest of four distinct systems at the host redshift of GRB$\sim$080810, among the lowest $N_{\mathrm{HI}}$ ever observed in a GRB host, despite the line of sight passing within a projected 5 kpc of the galaxy centres. By detailed analysis of the corresponding metal absorption lines, we derive chemical, ionic and kinematic properties of the individual absorbing systems, and thus build a picture of the host as a whole. Striking differences between the systems imply that the line of sight passes through several phases of gas: the star-forming regions of the GRB host; enriched material in the form of a galactic outflow; the hot and ionised halo of a second, interacting galaxy falling towards the host at a line-of-sight velocity of 700 km s$^{-1}$; and a cool, metal-poor cloud which may represent one of the best candidates yet for the inflow of metal-poor gas from the intergalactic medium.},

abstract = {The 5-yr Dark Energy Survey Supernova Programme (DES-SN) is one of the largest and deepest transient surveys to date in terms of volume and number of supernovae. Identifying and characterizing the host galaxies of transients plays a key role in their classification, the study of their formation mechanisms, and the cosmological analyses. To derive accurate host galaxy properties, we create depth-optimized coadds using single-epoch DES-SN images that are selected based on sky and atmospheric conditions. For each of the five DES-SN seasons, a separate coadd is made from the other four seasons such that each SN has a corresponding deep coadd with no contaminating SN emission. The coadds reach limiting magnitudes of order ∼27 in g band, and have a much smaller magnitude uncertainty than the previous DES-SN host templates, particularly for faint objects. We present the resulting multiband photometry of host galaxies for samples of spectroscopically confirmed type Ia (SNe Ia), core-collapse (CCSNe), and superluminous (SLSNe) as well as rapidly evolving transients (RETs) discovered by DES-SN. We derive host galaxy stellar masses and probabilistically compare stellar-mass distributions to samples from other surveys. We find that the DES spectroscopically confirmed sample of SNe Ia selects preferentially fewer high-mass hosts at high-redshift compared to other surveys, while at low redshift the distributions are consistent. DES CCSNe and SLSNe hosts are similar to other samples, while RET hosts are unlike the hosts of any other transients, although these differences have not been disentangled from selection effects.},

abstract = {As a first step in a survey for remote galaxies we have acquired low-resolution (AX =10 A) spectra of 68 high-redshift QSOs. The idea is to locate the large column density of neutral hydrogen in the disks of foreground galaxies through the detection of Lya absorption lines broadened by radiation damping. The damped lines are valuable signatures of high-redshift galaxies, since they are predicted to be much stronger than Lya absorption lines typically found in the spectra of QSOs. One of the principal goals of this paper is to present a list of absorption features that are candidates for " Lya disks. " The spectra of all 68 QSOs are presented as plots of flux, F x , versus wavelength, along with o Fx , the 1 a error in F x , versus wavelength. The plots also designate absorption features that are located blueward of Lya emission and deemed to be significant by criteria discussed below. A list of these features, presumed to consist of one or more Lya fines, is given that includes the measured equivalent widths and their 1 a errors. We also present a fist of absorption features that are candidates for " Lya disks.'' This fist, a subset of the first fist, comprises 47 absorption features with rest-frame equivalent widths W> 5 A. Investigations of 26 of these show that 15 are in fact damped Lya and that 10 are blends of multiple narrow components that are separated by Doppler velocities of -1000 km s _ x . Preliminary evidence indicates that the damped fines and the multicomponent fines are drawn from distinct populations of absorbers.},

abstract = {Observations of damped Ly systems offer a unique window on the neutral-gas reservoirs that gave rise to galaxies at high redshifts. This review focuses on critical properties such as the H I and metal content of the gas and on independent evidence for star formation. Together, these provide an emerging picture of gravitationally bound objects in which accretion of gas from the IGM replenishes gas consumed by star formation. Other properties such as dust content, molecular content, ionized-gas content, gas kinematics, and galaxy identifications are also reviewed. These properties point to a multiphase ISM in which radiative and hydrodynamic feedback processes are present. Numerical simulations and other types of models used to describe damped Ly systems within the context of galaxy formation are also discussed.},

abstract = {We describe a technique that for the first time measures star formation rates (SFRs) in damped Lyman alpha systems(DLAs) directly. We assume that massive stars form in DLAs, and that the FUV radiation they emit heats the gas by the grain photoelectric mechanism. We infer the heating rate from the cooling rate measured by the strength of CII* 1335.7 absorption. Since the heating rate is proportional to the dust-to-gas ratio and the SFR per unit area, we deduce the SFR per unit area for DLAs in which both quantities have been measured. We consider models in which the the dust comprises carbonaceous or silicate grains. We present two-phase models where the cold neutral medium (CNM) and warm neutral medium (WNM) are in pressuer equilibrium. In the CNM model the the sightline goes throught the CNM and WNM, while in the WNM model it goes only through the WNM. Since the grain photoelectric heating efficiency is at least 10 times higher in the CNM than in the WNM, CII* absorption mainly arises in the CNM in the CNM model. But in the WNM model all of the CII* absorption arises in the WNM. We use CII* absorption lines to derive the SFR per unit area for a sample of $\sim$ 30 DLAs in which the dust-to-gas ratio has been inferred from element depletion patterns. We show that the resulting SFR per unit area corresponds to an average over the star forming volume of galaxy hosting the DLA rather than to local star formation along the line of sight. We find the average SFR per unit area and equals10$^{-2.2}$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$ for the CNM model and 10$^{-1.3}$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$ for the WNM model. The SFR per unit area in the CNM solution is similar to that measured in the Milky Way ISM.},

abstract = {Observations show that at least some gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) happen simultane-ously with core-collapse supernovae (SNe), thus linking by a common thread nature's two grandest explosions. We review here the growing evidence for and theoretical implications of this association, and conclude that most long-duration soft-spectrum GRBs are accompanied by massive stellar explosions (GRB-SNe). The kinetic energy and luminosity of well-studied GRB-SNe appear to be greater than those of ordinary SNe, but evidence exists, even in a limited sample, for considerable diversity. The existing sample also suggests that most of the energy in the explosion is contained in nonrelativistic ejecta (producing the supernova) rather than in the relativistic jets responsible for making the burst and its afterglow. Neither all SNe, nor even all SNe of Type Ibc produce GRBs. The degree of differential rotation in the collapsing iron core of massive stars when they die may be what makes the difference.},

abstract = {Following an initial explosion that might be launched either by magnetic interactions or neutrinos, a rotating magnetar radiating according to the classic dipole formula could power a very luminous supernova. While some 56Ni might be produced in the initial explosion, the peak of the light curve in a Type I supernova would not be directly related to its mass. In fact, the peak luminosity would be most sensitive to the dipole field strength of the magnetar. The tail of the light curve could resemble radioactive decay for some time but, assuming complete trapping of the pulsar emission, would eventually be brighter. Depending on the initial explosion energy, both high and moderate velocities could accompany a very luminous light curve.},

abstract = {We train a deep residual convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the gas-phase metallicity (Z) of galaxies derived from spectroscopic information (Z ≡ 12+log(O/H)) using only three-band gri images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. When trained and tested on 128 × 128-pixel images, the root mean squared error (RMSE) of Z pred − Z true is only 0.085 dex, vastly outperforming a trained random forest algorithm on the same data set (RMSE = 0.130 dex). The amount of scatter in Z pred − Z true decreases with increasing image resolution in an intuitive manner. We are able to use CNN-predicted Z pred and independently measured stellar masses to recover a mass-metallicity relation with 0.10 dex scatter. Because our predicted MZR shows no more scatter than the empirical MZR, the difference between Z pred and Z true can not be due to purely random error. This suggests that the CNN has learned a representation of the gas-phase metallicity, from the optical imaging, beyond what is accessible with oxygen spectral lines.},

We provide a main Chandra source catalog, which contains 740 X-ray sources that are detected with WAVDETECT at a false-positive probability threshold of 10-5 in at least one of three X-ray bands (0.5-8keV, full band; 0.5-2keV, soft band; and 2-8keV, hard band) and also satisfy a binomial-probability source-selection criterion of P < 0.004 (i.e., the probability of sources not being real is less than 0.004); this approach is designed to maximize the number of reliable sources detected. A total of 300 main-catalog sources are new compared to the previous 2Ms CDF-S main-catalog sources. We determine X-ray source positions using centroid and matched-filter techniques and obtain a median positional uncertainty of ≈0″.42. We also provide a supplementary catalog, which consists of 36 sources that are detected with WAVDETECT at a false-positive probability threshold of 10 -5, satisfy the condition of 0.004 < P < 0.1, and have an optical counterpart with R < 24. Multiwavelength identifications, basic optical/infrared/radio photometry, and spectroscopic/photometric redshifts are provided for the X-ray sources in the main and supplementary catalogs. Seven hundred sixteen (≈97%) of the 740 main-catalog sources have multiwavelength counterparts, with 673 (≈94% of 716) having either spectroscopic or photometric redshifts. The 740 main-catalog sources span broad ranges of full-band flux and 0.5-8keV luminosity; the 300 new main-catalog sources span similar ranges although they tend to be systematically lower. Basic analyses of the X-ray and multiwavelength properties of the sources indicate that >75% of the main-catalog sources are active galactic nuclei (AGNs); of the 300 new main-catalog sources, about 35% are likely normal and starburst galaxies, reflecting the rise of normal and starburst galaxies at the very faint flux levels uniquely accessible to the 4Ms CDF-S. Near the center of the 4Ms CDF-S (i.e., within an off-axis angle of 3′), the observed AGN and galaxy source densities have reached 9800+1300- 1100deg-2 and 6900+1100- 900deg-2, respectively. Simulations show that our main catalog is highly reliable and is reasonably complete. The mean backgrounds (corrected for vignetting and exposure-time variations) are 0.063 and 0.178 counts Ms-1pixel-1 (for a pixel size of 0″.492) for the soft and hard bands, respectively; the majority of the pixels have zero background counts. The 4Ms CDF-S reaches on-axis flux limits of ≈3.2 × 10-17, 9.1 × 10 -18, and 5.5 × 10-17ergcm-2s-1 for the full, soft, and hard bands, respectively. An increase in the CDF-S exposure time by a factor of ≈2-2.5 would provide further significant gains and probe key unexplored discovery space. {\textcopyright} 2011.

abstract = {We develop one-zone galaxy formation models in the early Universe, taking into account dust formation and evolution by supernova (SN) explosions. Especially we focus on the time evolution of dust size distribution, because ${\rm H}_{2}$ formation on the dust surface plays a critical role in the star formation process in the early Universe. In the model we assume that star formation rate (SFR) is proportional to the total amount of ${\rm H}_{2}$. We consistently treat (i) the formation and size evolution of dust, (ii) the chemical reaction networks including ${\rm H}_{2}$ formation both on the surface of dust and in gas phase, and (iii) the SFR in the model. First, we find that, because of dust destruction due to both reverse and forward shocks driven by SNe, H$_{2}$ formation is more suppressed than that without dust destruction. At the galaxy age of $sim0.8 {\rm Gyr}$, for galaxy models with virial mass $M_{\rm vir}=10^{9} M_{\odot}$ and formation redshift $z_{\rm vir}=10$, the molecular fraction is 2.5 orders of magnitude less in the model with dust destruction by both shocks than that in the model without dust destruction. Second, we show that the H$_{2}$ formation rate strongly depends on the ISM density around SN progenitors. The SFR in higher ISM density is lower, since dust destruction by reverse shocks is more effective in higher ISM density. We conclude that not only the amount but also the size distribution of dust being related with the star formation activity strongly affects the evolution of galaxies in the early Universe.},

abstract = {iPTF13ehe is a hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova (SLSN) at z = 0.3434, with a slow-evolving light curve and spectral features similar to SN2007bi. It rises in 83–148 days to reach a peak bolometric luminosity of ∼1.3 × 10 44 erg s −1 , then decays slowly at 0.015 mag day −1 . The measured ejecta velocity is ∼ 13,000 km s −1 . The inferred explosion characteristics, such as the ejecta mass (70–220 M e), and the total radiative and kinetic energy (E rad ∼ 10 51 erg, E kin ∼ 2 × 10 53 erg), are typical of slow-evolving H-poor SLSN events. However, the late-time spectrum taken at +251 days (rest, post-peak) reveals a Balmer H$\alpha$ emission feature with broad and narrow components, which has never been detected before among other H-poor SLSNe. The broad component has a velocity width of ∼4500 km s −1 and a ∼300 km s −1 blueward shift relative to the narrow component. We interpret this broad H$\alpha$ emission with a luminosity of ∼2 × 10 41 erg s −1 as resulting from the interaction between the supernova ejecta and a discrete H-rich shell, located at a distance of ∼4 × 10 16 cm from the explosion site. This interaction causes the rest-frame r-band LC to brighten at late times. The fact that the late-time spectra are not completely absorbed by the shock-ionized H-shell implies that its Thomson scattering optical depth is likely 1, thus setting upper limits on the shell mass 30 M e . Of the existing models, a Pulsational Pair Instability supernova model can naturally explain the observed 30 M e H-shell, ejected from a progenitor star with an initial mass of (95–150) M e about 40 years ago. We estimate that at least ∼15% of all SLSNe-I may have late-time Balmer emission lines.},

abstract = {We report the first maximum-light far-Ultraviolet to near-infrared spectra (1000A - 1.62um, rest) of a H-poor superluminous supernova, Gaia16apd. At z=0.1018, it is one of the closest and the UV brightest such events, with 17.4 (AB) magnitude in Swift UV band (1928A) at -11days pre-maximum. Assuming an exponential form, we derived the rise time of 33days and the peak bolometric luminosity of 3x10^{44}ergs^-1. At maximum light, the estimated photospheric temperature and velocity are 17,000K and 14,000kms^-1 respectively. The inferred radiative and kinetic energy are roughly 1x10^{51} and 2x10^{52}erg. Gaia16apd is extremely UV luminous, emitting 50% of its total luminosity at 1000 - 2500A. Compared to the UV spectra (normalized at 3100A) of well studied SN1992A (Ia), SN2011fe(Ia), SN1999em (IIP) and SN1993J (IIb), it has orders of magnitude more far-UV emission. This excess is interpreted primarily as a result of weaker metal line blanketing due to much lower abundance of iron-group elements in the outer ejecta. Because these elements originate either from the natal metallicity of the star, or have been newly produced, our observation provides direct evidence that little of these freshly synthesized material, including 56Ni, was mixed into the outer ejecta, and the progenitor metallicity is likely sub-solar. This rules out Pair-Instability Supernova (PISN) models with Helium core masses >=90Msun, where substantial 56Ni material is produced. Higher photospheric temperature of Gaia16apd than that of normal SNe may also contribute to the observed far-UV excess. We find some indication that UV luminous SLSNe-I like Gaia16apd could be common. Our tentative comparison with published synthetic spectra indicates that Gaia16apd may be an explosion of a massive C+O core with a sub-solar metal abundance. Using the UV spectra, we show that WFIRST could detect SLSNe-I out to redshift of 8.},

abstract = {We studied Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) escape in a statistical sample of 43 Green Peas with HST/COS Ly$\alpha$ spectra. Green Peas are nearby star-forming galaxies with strong [OIII]$\lambda$5007 emission lines. Our sample is four times larger than the previous sample and covers a much more complete range of Green Pea properties. We found that about 2/3 of Green Peas are strong Ly$\alpha$ line emitters with rest-frame Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width > 2 A. The Ly$\alpha$ profiles of Green Peas are diverse. The Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction, defined as the ratio of observed Ly$\alpha$ flux to intrinsic Ly$\alpha$ flux, shows anti-correlations with a few Ly$\alpha$ kinematic features – both the blue peak and red peak velocities, the peak separations, and FWHM of the red portion of the Ly$\alpha$ profile. Using properties measured from SDSS optical spectra, we found many correlations – Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction generally increases at lower dust reddening, lower metallicity, lower stellar mass, and higher [OIII]/[OII] ratio. We fit their Ly$\alpha$ profiles with the HI shell radiative transfer model and found Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction anti-correlates with the best-fit N HI . Finally, we fit an empirical linear relation to predict f Ly$\alpha$ esc from the dust extinction and Ly$\alpha$ red peak velocity. The standard deviation of this relation is about 0.3 dex. This relation can be used to isolate the effect of IGM scatterings from Ly$\alpha$ escape and to probe the IGM optical depth along the line of sight of each z > 7 Ly$\alpha$ emission line galaxy in the JWST era.},

abstract = {We investigate whether dilution in some elliptical galaxies is the cause of a positive correlation between specific star formation rate (sSFR) and gas-phase metallicity (Z g) at high stellar mass in the local Universe. In the Munich semi-analytic model of galaxy formation, L-GALAXIES, massive, low-sSFR, elliptical galaxies are seen to undergo a gradual dilution of their interstellar medium, via accretion of metal-poor gas in cold-gas clumps and low-mass satellites. This occurs after a merger-induced starburst and the associated supernova feedback have quenched most of the original gas reservoir. Signatures of this evolution are present in these model galaxies at z = 0, including low gas fractions, large central black holes, old ages, and importantly, low (Z g −Z *). Remarkably, all of these properties are also found in massive, low-sSFR, elliptical galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey data release 7 (SDSS-DR7). This provides strong, indirect evidence that gradual dilution is also occurring in nearby ellipticals in the real Universe. This scenario provides an explanation for the positive correlation between SFR and Z g measured in high-M * galaxies, and therefore has consequences for the local fundamental metallicity relation, which assumes a weak anticorrelation above ∼10 10.5 M .},

abstract = {Recent models of rotating massive stars including magnetic fields prove it difficult for the cores of single stars to retain enough angular momentum to produce a collapsar and gamma-ray burst. At low metallicity, even very massive stars may retain a massive hydrogen envelope due to the weakness of the stellar winds, posing an additional obstacle to the collapsar model. Here, we consider the evolution of massive, magnetic stars where rapid rotation induces almost chemically homogeneous evolution. We find that in this case, the requirements of the collapsar model are rather easily fulfilled if the metallicity is sufficiently small: 1) rapidly rotating helium stars are formed without the need to remove the hydrogen envelope, avoiding mass-loss induced spin-down. 2) Angular momentum transport from the helium core to hydrogen envelope by magnetic torques is insignificant. We demonstrate this by calculating evolutionary models of massive stars with various metallicities, and derive an upper metallicity limit for this scenario based on currently proposed mass loss rates. Our models also suggest the existence of a lower CO-core mass limit of about 10 M – which relates to an initial mass of only about 20 M within our scenario – for GRB production. We argue that the relative importance of the considered GRB progenitor channel, compared to any channel related to binary stars, may increase with decreasing metallicity, and that this channel might be the major path to GRBs from first stars.},

Gamma-ray bursts, owing to their brightness and association with massive stars, offer hope of clarifying this situation, provided that the GRB rate can be properly related to the SFR. The Swift GRB data reveal an increasing evolution in the GRB rate relative to the SFR at intermediate z; taking this into account, we use the highest-z GRB data to make a new determination of the SFR at z = 4-7. Our results exceed the lowest direct SFR measurements, and imply that no steep drop exists in the SFR up to at least z $\sim$ 6.5. We discuss the implications of our result for cosmic reionization, the efficiency of the universe in producing stellar-mass black holes, and ``GRB feedback'' in star-forming hosts.},

abstract = {We analyze the near-infrared to UV data of 16 quasars with redshifts ranging from 0.71 $<$ $z$ $<$ 2.13 to investigate dust extinction properties. The sample presented in this work is obtained from the High $A_V$ Quasar (HAQ) survey. The quasar candidates were selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS), and follow-up spectroscopy was carried out at the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) and the New Technology Telescope (NTT). To study dust extinction curves intrinsic to the quasars, from the HAQ survey we selected 16 cases where the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) law could not provide a good solution to the spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We derived the extinction curves using Fitzpatrick & Massa 1986 (FM) law by comparing the observed SEDs to the combined quasar template from Vanden Berk et al. 2001 and Glikman et al. 2006. The derived extinction, $A_V$, ranges from 0.2-1.0 mag. All the individual extinction curves of our quasars are steeper ($R_V=2.2$-2.7) than that of the SMC, with a weighted mean value of $R_V=2.4$. We derive an `average quasar extinction curve' for our sample by fitting SEDs simultaneously by using the weighted mean values of the FM law parameters and a varying $R_V$. The entire sample is well fit with a single best-fit value of $R_V=2.2\pm0.2$. The `average quasar extinction curve' deviates from the steepest Milky Way and SMC extinction curves at a confidence level $\gtrsim95\%$. Such steep extinction curves suggest a significant population of silicates to produce small dust grains. Moreover, another possibility could be that the large dust grains may have been destroyed by the activity of the nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN), resulting in steep extinction curves.},

abstract = {Context. Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows are excellent and sensitive probes of gas and dust in star-forming galaxies at all epochs. It has been posited that dust in the early Universe must be different from dust at lower redshifts. To date two reports in the literature directly support this contention, one of which is based on the spectral shape of the afterglow spectrum of GRB 050904 at z = 6.295.  Aims: Here we reinvestigate the afterglow of GRB 050904 to understand cosmic dust at high redshift. We address the claimed evidence for unusual (supernova-origin) dust in its host galaxy by simultaneously examining the X-ray and optical/near-infrared spectrophotometric data of the afterglow.  Methods: We derived the intrinsic spectral energy distribution (SED) of the afterglow at three different epochs, 0.47, 1.25, and 3.4 days after the burst. We reduced again the Swift X-ray data, the 1.25 days FORS2 z-Gunn photometric data, the spectroscopic and z'-band photometric data at $\sim$3 days from the Subaru telescope, as well as the critical UKIRT Z-band photometry at 0.47 days, upon which the claim of dust detection largely relies.  Results: We find no evidence of dust extinction in the SED at any time. We computed flux densities at $\lambda$_rest = 1250 {\AA} directly from the observed counts at all epochs. In the earliest epoch, 0.47 days, where the claim of dust is strongest, the Z-band suppression is found to be weaker (0.3 ± 0.2 mag) than previously reported and statistically insignificant (<1.5$\sigma$). Furthermore, we find that the photometry of this band is unstable and difficult to calibrate.  Conclusions: From the afterglow SED we demonstrate that there is no evidence of dust extinction in GRB 050904 - the SED at all times can be reproduced without dust, and at 1.25 days in particular, significant extinction can be excluded, with A(3000 {\AA}) < 0.27 mag at 95% confidence using the supernova-type extinction curve. We conclude that there is no evidence of any extinction in the afterglow of GRB 050904 and that the presence of supernova-origin dust in the host of GRB 050904 must be viewed skeptically.},

abstract = {Among the key parameters defining the ISM of galaxies is the fraction of the metals that are locked up in dust: the metals-to-dust ratio. This ratio bears not only on the ISM and its evolution, but particularly on the origin of cosmic dust. We combine extinction and abundance data from GRB afterglows, from QSO absorbers, as well as from galaxy-lensed QSOs, to determine the metals-to-dust ratios for lines-of-sight through a wide diversity of galaxies from blue, dwarf starbursts to massive ellipticals, across a vast range in redshift z=0.1-6.3, and nearly three orders of magnitude in column density and metal abundance. We thus determine the metals-to-dust ratio in a unique way, providing direct determinations of in situ gas and dust columns without recourse to assumptions with large uncertainties. We find that the metals-to-dust ratios in these systems are surprisingly close to the value for the local group (10^{21.3} cm-2 A_V mag-1), with a mean value of 10^{21.2} cm-2 A_V mag-1 and a standard deviation of 0.3 dex. There is no evidence of deviation from this mean ratio as a function of metallicity, even down to our lowest metallicity of 0.01 Z/Z_sun. The lack of any obvious dependence of the metals-to-dust ratio on either column density, galaxy type or age, redshift, or metallicity indicates a close correspondence between the formation of the metals and the formation of dust. Any delay between the formation of metals and dust must be shorter than the typical metal-enrichment times of these galaxies. Formation of the bulk of the dust in low mass stars is therefore ruled out by these data at any cosmic epoch. Furthermore, dust destruction must not dominate over formation/growth in virtually any galaxy environment. The correlation between metals and dust is a natural consequence of the formation of the bulk of dust in SNe [Abridged].},

abstract = {The brightness of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows and their occurrence in young, blue galaxies make them excellent probes to study star forming regions in the distant Universe. We here elucidate dust extinction properties in the early Universe through the analysis of the afterglows of all known z > 6 GRBs: GRB 090423, 080913 and 050904, at z = 8.2, 6.69, and 6.295, respectively. We gather all available optical and near-infrared photometry, spectroscopy and X-ray data to construct spectral energy distributions (SEDs) at multiple epochs. We then fit the SEDs at all epochs with a dust-attenuated power-law or broken power-law. We find no evidence for dust extinction in GRB 050904 and GRB 090423, with possible evidence for a low level of extinction in GRB 080913. We compare the high redshift GRBs to a sample of lower redshift GRB extinctions and find a lack of even moderately extinguished events (AV $\sim$ 0.3) above z > 4. In spite of the biased selection and small number statistics, this result hints at a decrease in dust content in star-forming environments at high redshifts.},

abstract = {The unequivocal, spectroscopic detection of the 2175 bump in extinction curves outside the Local Group is rare. To date, the properties of the bump have been examined in only two GRB afterglows (GRB 070802 and GRB 080607). In this work we analyse in detail the detections of the 2175 extinction bump in the optical spectra of the two further GRB afterglows: GRB 080605 and 080805. We gather all available optical/NIR photometric, spectroscopic and X-ray data to construct multi-epoch SEDs for both GRB afterglows. We fit the SEDs with the Fitzpatrick & Massa (1990) model with a single or broken PL. We also fit a sample of 38 GRB afterglows, known to prefer a SMC-type extinction curve, with the same model. We find that the SEDs of GRB 080605 and GRB 080805 at two epochs are fit well with a single PL with a derived extinction of A_V = 0.52(+0.13 -0.16) and 0.50 (+0.13 -0.10), and 2.1(+0.7-0.6) and 1.5+/-0.2 respectively. While the slope of the extinction curve of GRB 080805 is not well-constrained, the extinction curve of GRB 080605 has an unusual very steep far-UV rise together with the 2175 bump. Such an extinction curve has previously been found in only a small handful of sightlines in the MW. One possible explanation of such an extinction curve may be dust arising from two different regions with two separate grain populations, however we cannot distinguish the origin of the curve. We finally compare the four 2175 bump sightlines to the larger GRB afterglow sample and to Local Group sightlines. We find that while the width and central positions of the bumps are consistent with what is observed in the Local Group, the relative strength of the detected bump (A_bump) for GRB afterglows is weaker for a given A_V than for almost any Local Group sightline. Such dilution of the bump strength may offer tentative support to a dual dust-population scenario.},

abstract = {GRB afterglows are well suited to extinction studies due to their brightness, simple power-law spectra and the occurrence of GRBs in distant star forming galaxies. In this paper we present results from the SED analysis of a sample of 41 GRB afterglows, from X-ray to NIR wavelengths. This is the largest sample of extinction curves outside the Local Group and, to date, the only extragalactic sample of absolute extinction curves based on spectroscopy. Visual extinction correlation with HI column density as well as total and gas-phase metal column density are examined. Approximately half the sample require a cooling break between the optical and X-ray regimes. The broken power-law SEDs show an average change in the spectral index of delta_beta=0.51 with a standard deviation of 0.02. This is consistent with the expectation from a simple synchrotron model. Of the sample, 63% are well described by the SMC-type extinction curve and have moderate or low extinction, with AV<0.65. Almost a quarter of our sample is consistent with no significant extinction (typically AV<0.1). The 2175AA extinction bump is detected unequivocally in 7% of our sample (3 GRBs), which all have A_V>1.0. We find an anti-correlation between gas-to-dust ratio and metallicity consistent with the Local Group relation. Our metals-to-dust ratios derived from the soft X-ray absorption are always larger (3-30 times) than the Local Group value, which may mean that GRB hosts may be less efficient at turning their metals into dust. However, we find that gas, dust, and metal column densities are all likely to be influenced by photo-ionization and dust destruction effects from the GRB. [abridged]},

abstract = {We analyze the optical continuum of star-forming galaxies in SDSS by fitting stacked spectra with stellar population synthesis models to investigate the relation between stellar mass, stellar metallicity, dust attenuation and star formation rate. We fit models calculated with star formation and chemical evolution histories that are derived empirically from multi-epoch observations of the stellar mass—star formation rate and the stellar mass—gas-phase metallicity relations, respectively. We also fit linear combinations of single burst models with a range of metallicities and ages. Star formation and chemical evolution histories are unconstrained for these models. The stellar mass—stellar metallicity relations obtained from the two methods agree with the relation measured from individual supergiant stars in nearby galaxies. These relations are also consistent with the relation obtained from emission line analysis of gas-phase metallicity after accounting for systematic offsets in the gas-phase-metallicity. We measure dust attenuation of the stellar continuum and show that its dependence on stellar mass and star formation rate is consistent with previously reported results derived from nebular emission lines. However, stellar continuum attenuation is smaller than nebular emission line attenuation. The continuum-to-nebular attenuation ratio depends on stellar mass and is smaller in more massive galaxies. Our consistent analysis of stellar continuum and nebular emission lines paves the way for a comprehensive investigation of stellar metallicities of star-forming and quiescent galaxies.},

abstract = {In this contribution, we present the first census of oxygen in star-forming galaxies in the local universe. We examine three samples of galaxies with metallicities and star formation rates (SFRs) at z = 0.07, 0.8, and 2.26, including the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and DEEP2 survey. We infer the total mass of oxygen produced and mass of oxygen found in the gas-phase from our local SDSS sample. The star formation history is determined by requiring that galaxies evolve along the relation between stellar mass and SFR observed in our three samples. We show that the observed relation between stellar mass and SFR for our three samples is consistent with other samples in the literature. The mass-metallicity relation is well established for our three samples, and from this we empirically determine the chemical evolution of star-forming galaxies. Thus, we are able to simultaneously constrain the SFRs and metallicities of galaxies over cosmic time, allowing us to estimate the mass of oxygen locked up in stars. Combining this work with independent measurements reported in the literature, we conclude that the loss of oxygen from the interstellar medium of local star-forming galaxies is likely to be a ubiquitous process with the oxygen mass loss scaling (almost) linearly with stellar mass. We estimate the total baryonic mass loss and argue that only a small fraction of the baryons inferred from cosmological observations accrete onto galaxies. {\textcopyright} 2012.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 SPIE The Dark Energy Survey (DES) is an operating optical survey aimed at understanding the accelerating expansion of the universe using four complementary methods: weak gravitational lensing, galaxy cluster counts, baryon acoustic oscillations, and Type Ia supernovae. To perform the 5000 sq-degree wide field and 30 sq-degree supernova surveys, the DES Collaboration built the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), a 3 square-degree, 570-Megapixel CCD camera that was installed at the prime focus of the Blanco 4-meter telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO). DES has completed its third observing season out of a nominal five. This paper describes DES “Year 4” (Y4) and “Year 5” (Y5), the survey strategy, an outline of the survey operations procedures, the efficiency of operations and the causes of lost observing time. It provides details about the quality of these two-season's data, a summary of the overall status, and plans for the final survey season.},

We improve the treatment of dust growth by accretion in the ISM to investigate the role of the temperature-dependent sticking coefficient and ion-grain interactions. From detailed observational data on the gas-phase Si abundances [Si gas /H] measured in the local Galaxy, we derive a relation between the average [Si gas /H] and the local gas density n(H) which we use as a critical con-straint for the models. This relation requires a sticking coefficient that decreases with the gas temperature. The relation predicted by the models reproduces the slope of −0.5 of the observed relation in cold clouds. It is steeper than that for the warm medium and is explained by the dust growth. We find that growth occurs in the cold medium for all adopted values of the minimum grain size a min from 1 to 5 nm. For the classical cut-off of a min = 5 nm, the Coulomb repulsion results in slower accretion and higher [Si gas /H] than the observed val-ues. For a min 3 nm, the Coulomb interactions enhance the growth rate, steepen the slope of [Si gas /H]–n(H) relation and provide a better match to observations. The rates of dust re-formation in the ISM by far exceed the rates of dust production by stellar sources. After the initial 140 Myr, the cycle of matter in and out of dust reaches a steady state, in which the dust growth balances the destruction on a similar timescale of 350 Myr.},

We fit most of the observed extinction pro?les. Failures occur for lines of sight presenting remarkable rises blueward the bump. We find a tendency in the carbon chemical structure to become more aliphatic with the galactic activity, and to some extent with increasing redshifts. Moreover, the contribution of the moleclar component to the total extinction is more important in younger objects. The results of the ?tting procedure (either successes and failures) may be naturally interpreted through an evolutionary prescription based on the carbon cycle in the interstellar medium of galaxies.},

We derive metallicities, depletion onto dust, extinction by dust and analyse the absorption from Mg ii, Mg i, Ca ii and Na i that are redshifted into the near infrared wavelength range. We show that most of them have high metallicity and dust content. We detect 9 Ca ii absorptions with W(Ca ii$\lambda$3934) > 0.23 {\AA} out of 14 systems where we have appropriate wavelength coverage. The observed equivalent widths are similar to what has been measured in other lower redshift surveys of Ca ii systems. We detect 10 Na i absorptions in the 11 systems where we could observe this absorption. The median equivalent width (W(Na i$\lambda$5891) = 0.68 {\AA}) is larger than what is observed in local clouds with similar H i column densities but also in z < 0.7 Ca ii systems detected in the SDSS. Most of the systems (12 out of 17) have W(Mg ii$\lambda$2796) > 2.5 {\AA} when six of them have log N(H i) < 20.3 with the extreme case of J1341+1852 which has log N(H i) = 18.18. The Mg ii absorptions are spread over more than ∆v ∼ 400 km s −1 for half of the systems; three absorbers have ∆v > 500 km s −1 . The kinematics is strongly perturbed for most of these systems which cannot arise in quiet disks and must be close to regions with intense star formation activity, contrary to what is usually observed for strong W > 2 {\AA} Mg ii systems and/or are part of objects in interaction. All this suggests that a large fraction of the cold gas at high redshift arises in disturbed environments.},
